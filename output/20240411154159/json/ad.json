        "Sabrina Scott walked out of prison before dusk fell.\n\nShe had been temporarily bailed out of jail for one day.\n\nHolding a slip of paper with an address on it in her hand, she took a bus at the gate of the prison. She arrived at an old mansion halfway up the mountain when it was almost nightfall. The doorman then led Sabrina into a bedroom.\n\nThe bedroom was pitch black, and she smelled thick, pungent blood as soon as she entered.\n\nBefore she had adapted herself to the darkness in the room, a pair of strong arms grabbed her and she fell into a man‚Äôs embrace.\n \nA hot breath blew by her ear. ‚ÄúSo, you are what they sent for me to enjoy before my death, the‚Ä¶ call girl?‚Äù\n \n‚ÄòCall... girl?‚Äô \n \nSabrina‚Äôs tears came rolling down her eyes. \n \nShe suddenly felt frightened, and her voice trembled. ‚ÄúAre you‚Ä¶ dying soon?‚Äù\n \n‚ÄúYes! Do you regret doing my business?‚Äù The man sneered faintly.\n \n‚ÄúI don‚Äôt regret it,‚Äù Sabrina said miserably.\n \nShe had no room for regret because her mother was waiting to be saved by her.\n \nAlthough she could not see the man‚Äôs face in the darkness, she could feel the man did not seem like somebody who is dying.\n\nA couple of hours later, the man finally fell asleep.\n \n‚ÄòIs he dead already?‚Äô\n \nSabrina had no time to be in fear, and she quickly fled the mansion.\n \nAt that time, the night sky began to rain heavily. She ran in the rain to the Lynn Residence.\n \nIt was eleven o‚Äôclock at night and the door to the Lynn Residence was locked. However, Sabrina could hear the joyful noise in the house as if there was something worth celebrating.\n \n‚ÄúOpen the door! Quickly, open the door and give me the money. I need to go save my mother‚Ä¶ Open the door! Open the door!‚Äù\n \nThe door was still locked.\n \nShe was muddle-headed and was a little unsteady on her feet at this point because she had waited for the bus in the rain for a long time before she had to run to Lynn Residence. However, she had to brace herself up and kept banging hard on the door of Lynn Residence. ‚ÄúOpen the door! Open the door! Quickly give me the money, I need to go save my mother‚Ä¶‚Äù \n \n‚ÄòBang!‚Äô The door was pushed open from inside, and Sabrina‚Äôs despaired gaze suddenly sparkled.\n \nThe person behind the door looked at Sabrina with contempt and disgust. \n \nSabrina knew that she looked worse than a beggar now.\n \nHowever, she could not care for her image now. She rushed up and looked at the person with a pleading look in her eyes. ‚ÄúI have done what you asked me to do, quickly give me the money, my mother‚Äôs life cannot wait any longer, please‚Ä¶‚Äù\n \n‚ÄúYour mother is dead, so you no longer need the money.‚Äù The person who opened the door threw a black-framed picture into the rain, then mercilessly closed the door.\n \n‚ÄúWhat?‚Äù Sabrina was stupefied as she stood motionless in the heavy rain. \n \nLong long afterward, she let out a harsh cry, ‚ÄúMother‚Ä¶‚Äù\n \n‚ÄúMother‚Ä¶I was late, wasn‚Äôt I? I missed the timing to save you, didn‚Äôt I? My mother is dead‚Ä¶My mother is dead‚Ä¶‚Äù Sabrina hugged her mother‚Äôs coffin portrait, curled up in the rain, and muttered to herself.\n \nShe then crawled up and started to bang on the door like a crazy person. ‚ÄúLiar! I‚Äôve done what I‚Äôve promised you, but you didn‚Äôt save my mother, return my mother to me! Liar! Your whole family will die horribly‚Ä¶ Liar! Liar! Liar! I curse that your whole family will have a terrible death!‚Äù\n \nSabrina fainted for crying too much outside the door of the Lynn Residence.\n \nWhen she woke up, three days had passed, and she was in prison again. \n \nShe was sent to the medical care area when she was in a coma because she had a high fever. Her fever came down after three days, and she was returned to the original imprisonment area.\n \nA few female inmates came and surrounded her. \n \n‚ÄúI thought she was released and freed after being bailed out, but she was sent back in again just after three days?‚Äù\n \n‚ÄúI heard she was lent out to be toyed with for a night.‚Äù\n \nThe well-built female gang leader pulled Sabrina‚Äôs hair and let out a burst of sinister laughter. ‚ÄúWhat a good life this woman had! Watch me beat her to death today!‚Äù\n \nSabrina did not even bat an eyelid.\n \nLet them beat her to death. If she were beaten to death, it would be perfect for her to reunite with her mother. \n \nAs the women started to strip Sabrina‚Äôs clothing, a stern voice came from the door. ‚ÄúWhat are you doing?‚Äù \n \nThe female gang leader instantly put on a fake smile. ‚ÄúSabrina was sick. We were just concern for her.‚Äù\n \nThe correctional officer did not answer but shouted Sabrina‚Äôs prison code. ‚Äú036, come out!‚Äù\n \nSabrina walked out and asked indifferently, ‚ÄúWhat did I do wrong now?‚Äù\n \n‚ÄúYou have been acquitted.‚Äù The correctional officer said blankly. \n \n‚ÄúWhat?‚Äù Sabrina thought she hallucinated. It was until when she was out of the prison door that she realized it was real. \n \nShe cried tears of joy and murmured, ‚ÄúMother! I couldn‚Äôt save you, but could you forgive me? I will see you now. Where are you buried‚Ä¶?‚Äù\n \n‚ÄúAre you Miss Scott?‚Äù a man‚Äôs voice came coldly, and then a man in a suit stood before Sabrina. Right behind the man, there was a black car stopped. Sabrina could vaguely see a man with shades was watching her from the car.\n \nShe nodded. ‚ÄúYes, that‚Äôs me. You‚Ä¶‚Äù\n \nThe man did not answer but turned around and spoke politely to the man in shades seated in the car. ‚ÄúYoung Master Sebastian, it‚Äôs her.‚Äù\n \n‚ÄúBring her over!‚Äù The man in shades ordered.\n \nSabrina, who was still confused, was pushed into the car and sat next to the man in shades. She immediately felt a cold murderous aura coming from him.\n \nSabrina felt her life was in his hands.\n \n‚ÄúI am Sebastian Ford.‚Äù The man introduced himself coldly.\n \nSabrina could not help but shivered and asked gently, ‚ÄúI have not been acquitted‚Ä¶but I am going to receive my death sentence, right?‚Äù\n \n‚ÄúI‚Äôm taking you to get a marriage certificate!‚Äù Sebastian was reluctant to even look at her once more. \n \nSabrina suddenly thought his voice was familiar. It sounded like the man that died that night. \n \nHowever, the man had died.\n \n‚ÄúWhat did you say?‚Äù She thought she had heard it wrong.\nSebastian did not look at Sabrina. ‚ÄúYou heard me.‚Äù\n\nSabrina fiddled with the edges of her filthy clothes and said in a soft voice, ‚ÄúSir, this joke is not funny at all.‚Äù\n\nSebastian sneered and said sharply, ‚ÄúWasn‚Äôt it your plan to be married to me all along?‚Äù\n\nSebastian‚Äôs gaze cut through Sabrina‚Äôs thin sunken face like a sharp razor and stared into her eyes. Sabrina shuddered and turned her head away, but Sebastian squeezed her chin and forced her to look at him. \n\nSabrina then realized that the features under the shades had a cool and beautiful outline. God definitely favored him because he looked so handsome. Moreover, that black stubble on his jawline exuded incomparable rugged masculinity. \n\nHis suit was well-tailored and looked luxurious. \n\nSabrina could tell this man was a very distinguished person.\n\nIn contrast, she was wearing worn out clothes covered in mold, with disheveled hair and dirty face. Moreover, her body was smelly because she had not showered for days. \n\nThe two of them were going to get a marriage certificate?\n\nSabrina lowered her gaze and said softly, ‚ÄúSir, do you think because I have been in jail for two years and had not seen any man, I would simply marry any random ugly man, even if I had not met him before?‚Äù\n\nSebastian could not help but took another look at her. \n\nShe was quite young, but had a sharp tongue, and was extraordinarily calm. His disgust towards her inevitably increased. ‚ÄúAre you deliberately using this method to anger me and to arouse my interest in you?‚Äù \n\nAs soon as he finished, he did not wait for Sabrina to answer but immediately ordered the driver, ‚ÄúTo the city hall!‚Äù\n\n‚ÄúLet me go! I don‚Äôt even know you!‚Äù Sabrina was horrified and wanted to get out of the car. \n\nWith a backhand motion, Sebastian pinned her against the seat with his elbow, glared at her with a sinister gaze, and said in a cold voice, ‚ÄúWoman, listen up! You will be dead if you dare to get off the car.‚Äù\n\nSabrina was scared. She had tears tumbling in her eyes, and she said in a weak voice, ‚ÄúI‚Ä¶don‚Äôt want to die.‚Äù\n\n‚ÄúTo the city hall!‚Äù The man ordered again. \n\n‚ÄúYoung Master Sebastian, do we go straight to the city hall?‚Äù asked the assistant in the front passenger seat. \n\nSebastian looked puzzled.\n\nThe assistant looked at Sabrina and said bluntly, ‚ÄúYoung Mistress‚Äô clothes are worn and old, and she looked dirty‚Ä¶‚Äù\n\n‚ÄúReturn to the Ford Residence!‚Äù The man gave another order.\n\n‚ÄúYes, Master Sebastian.‚Äù The driver started the engine. \n\nOne and half hours later, the car stopped. \n\nSabrina got out of the car and saw the grand mansion that was the Ford Residence. It was located halfway up the mountain. \n\nThere was a world of difference compared to the mansion located halfway up another mountain that she had seen three days ago. This looked like a palace, whereas the mansion from three days ago was like a dilapidated prison. The man that took her innocence would probably be a death row inmate. \n\nShe was still lost in her thoughts when Sebastian grabbed her wrist.\n\nWhen he pulled her along and strode forward, she had to jog behind like a stray puppy because she was much shorter than him.\n\nThe maids in the mansion bowed politely upon seeing the man. ‚ÄúWelcome back, Young Master Sebastian.‚Äù\n\nThe man led Sabrina through the main house towards the low-levelled rooms in the yard. He handed Sabrina to a few maids and said, ‚ÄúFind some clean clothes for her, and let her take a bath.‚Äù\n\n‚ÄúYes, Master Sebastian.‚Äù The maids answered and brought Sabrina to the bathroom.\n\nShe must escape from here.\n\nShe could not be with a man that wished to have her killed but still wanted to get the marriage certificate with her right after she came out from prison. \n\nSabrina was so deep in her thoughts that she did not realize the maids had already taken most of her clothes off. \n\nThe maids sighed together.\n\n‚ÄúThose bruises on her neck seemed to be love bites?‚Äù\n\nWhen Sabrina had regained her focus, she frantically bit her lips and said, ‚ÄúI‚Äôm not used to others bathing me. Please leave, and I will bathe myself.‚Äù\n\nOne of the maids asked, ‚ÄúYou are Young Master Sebastian‚Äôs‚Ä¶‚Äù\n\nSabrina quickly interjected and said, ‚ÄúMaid.‚Äù\n\n‚ÄúBathe yourself then.‚Äù The maids turned around and left impolitely. \n\nWhen they went out, one of the maids let out a cold snort in a sarcastic way, ‚ÄúI thought she was Young Master Sebastian‚Äôs woman. She turned out to be only a maid. She looked like a promiscuous thing. Who did she think she was to let us bath her?‚Äù \n\nWhen the maid looked up, she saw Sebastian standing right outside the bathroom. The maid immediately shut her mouth in fear. \n\nIn the bathroom, Sabrina looked at herself in the mirror with her face flushed red.\n\nHer most precious first time was taken by a man whom she had never even met. In addition, she would never know what he looked like forever. \n\nShe shut her eyes, and tears glided from her cheeks to her neck.\n\n‚ÄúYou really are a filthy woman!‚Äù said a harsh male voice. \n\nSabrina opened her eyes in a panic.\n\nSebastian was looking at her neck with disgust.\n\nSabrina frantically covered herself with her clothes. The tears of anger and shame came sliding down her face. ‚ÄúI was just released from prison, and you kidnapped me here. I don‚Äôt know you. No matter how filthy I am, it has nothing to do with you, right? Please get out!‚Äù\n\nSebastian‚Äôs disgusted gaze landed on Sabrina‚Äôs face, but he could not identify her tell that showed that she was acting.\n\nThis woman truly was a skilled swindler. \n\n‚ÄúFollow me to get our marriage certificate once you‚Äôre done washing up. Three months later, I would divorce you, then pay you a certain amount of money. When that time comes, if you wished to stay beside me for even one more second, it would not be possible!‚Äù Once he finished his sentence, he closed the door and left.\n\nThe maids in the yard dared not breathe too loudly because Sebastian was present. \n\nFour days ago, at this house, all the maids had witnessed how vicious and domineering this newly appointed head of the Ford family can be.\n\nSebastian was the fourth son of his father, and his father was the eldest son of the Ford family. His three brothers and him were not born by the same mother. He was an illegitimate son. Although the Ford family was a century-old noble family, a b*stard like Sebastian would not have the eligibility to inherit even a tiny portion of the Ford family‚Äôs fortune.\n\nIn the Ford family, the collateral descendants even had priority over him for inheritance. \n\nWhen he was a teenager, he had been driven into exile. However, he finally fought his way back one day and managed to return to his country, but his mother was framed and imprisoned.\n\nSince then, Sebastian had been calculating every step meticulously and executing his plan in secret.\n\nFinally, he faked his death three days ago and engaged a counterattack.\n\nAs a result, he drove his opponents to an end and had successfully gained control over the whole Ford family. \n\nIn the current Ford family, Sebastian has the final say. \n\nSebastian could only feel coldness in his gut whenever he recalled his past. \n\nHis mother did not willingly become the third person in his father‚Äôs marriage. It was a trick used by his father‚Äôs wife to keep his father in their marriage. \n\nWhen Sebastian‚Äôs mother found out that his father had a family, she was already nine months pregnant.\n\nIn order to let her son grow up in the company of parents, his mother had no choice but to stay by his father‚Äôs side and suffered humiliation in silence. She was even framed and imprisoned when she was in her middle age. When Sebastian finally gained control of the Ford family and got his mother out of prison, she only had three months to live.\n\nHis mother only had one wish. She wanted him to take her cellmate, Sabrina Scott, as his bride.\n\nSebastian could only obey her wish, seeing that his mother did not have much time left.\n\nThe night before he decided to take Sabrina out of prison, he had done a thorough investigation on her.\n\nHis investigation showed that this woman had an ulterior motive for getting close to his mother.\n\n‚ÄúSomething‚Äôs wrong, Young Master Sebastian!‚Äù The maid‚Äôs frightened exclamation interrupted his thoughts.\n\nSebastian‚Äôs gaze instantly turned serious. ‚ÄúWhat are you panicking about?‚Äù\n\n‚ÄúThat woman‚Ä¶ escaped by jumping out of the window,‚Äù the maid said in fear.\n‚ÄúWhat?‚Äù A frown instantly formed on Sebastian‚Äôs face, and he immediately rushed in the bathroom. \n\nThere was nobody in the bathroom, but on the wall, a line of words written in blood was left. ‚ÄòMr. Ford, despite our substantial differences in terms of social status, I wouldn‚Äôt want to marry you, farewell!‚Äô\n\nThe handwriting was neat and sharp, which revealed the writer‚Äôs unyielding trait. \n\nSebastian was stunned by it.\n\nCould his investigation result on her be wrong?\n\nA few seconds later, he gave an order. ‚ÄúSearch the back of the mountain!‚Äù\n\nHe could not let his mother have any regrets before she died.\n\nAt the back of the mountain, holding onto thorns and vines to go down, Sabrina managed to escape the search from the Ford family by hiding under a dense vine, despite having her clothes torn.\n\nShe stayed there till nightfall and went around the mountain by climbing over.\n\nEarly morning on the following day, she went to the Lynn Residence again. Lincoln Lynn and Jade Sullivan were shocked and panicked when they saw Sabrina.\n\n‚ÄúYou, how did you escape from prison?‚Äù Jade asked with a guilty expression.\n\nSabrina said mockingly, ‚ÄúMrs. Lynn, I have been released after serving my full sentence.‚Äù\n\n‚ÄúYou still shouldn‚Äôt have come to our house. You‚Äôre dirty and smelly, it‚Äôs too pungent! Get out of here quickly!‚Äù Jade forcefully chased Sabrina out of the house.\n\nSabrina could not be bothered to even look at Jade. She only looked at Lincoln and asked, ‚ÄúUncle Lynn, your family knew very well why I was imprisoned back then, right? Four days ago, you came to visit me in jail and told me if I followed the address given and stayed with a man for a night, you would give me a sum to save my mother. So, I stayed with that man, but my mother died.‚Äù\n\nLincoln felt guilty but argued, ‚ÄúEveryone has their fate! I was kind and wanted to save your mother, but your mother died too soon! Could you blame me for that?‚Äù\n\nSabrina glared furiously at Lincoln. \n\nShe had to pierce her nails into her flesh, only then could she suppress her urge to rush up to Lincoln and bite him to death. This is because she did not have the capabilities to investigate whether her mother‚Äôs death had any relations to the Lynn family yet.\n\nShe gritted her teeth and asked calmly, ‚ÄúWhere was my mother buried?‚Äù\n\nLincoln answered in vague tone, ‚ÄúOf course she was buried in the soil cemetery back at your hometown! I have paid for your living expenses and studies for eight years. Do I still need to buy a premium cemetery plot for your mother? You ungrateful person, leave now!‚Äù\n\nAs Lincoln closed the door, he tossed a thousand dollars and said, ‚ÄúThis was for your service that night.‚Äù\n\nA stab in Sabrina‚Äôs heart could be felt every time that night was mentioned.\n\nEven she felt miserable, she still raised her chin high and stubbornly said, ‚ÄúIf someone had to pay, shouldn‚Äôt it be that man who needed to pay me? Since he is dead, then there is no use for it! Besides, I'm not a call girl! The reason I promised you was, firstly, to save my mother, and secondly, to repay your kindness for nurturing me. So from now on, our debt is cleared!‚Äù\n\nEight years living under the Lynn family‚Äôs fence was enough!\n\nShe would never return to the Lynn family in the future.\n\nIf she were to be back, it would be to avenge her mother.\n\nAs he watched a tattered-looking Sabrina leave the house with such determination, Lincoln suddenly felt a dull pain on his chest.\n\nJade immediately scolded him furiously, ‚ÄúWhy? Do you feel sorry for her and her mother? Lincoln Lynn, don‚Äôt forget she cursed my daughter to death! They were born on the same day. Why does she get to live, and my daughter died right after birth?‚Äù\n\nLincoln said, ‚ÄúI‚Ä¶ I am not feeling sorry for her. The most important thing now is that she is out of prison. If she knew the man that she had slept with did not die but became the head of the Ford family, then we are going to be in big trouble!‚Äù\n\nJade sneered and said, ‚ÄúShe didn‚Äôt even know who she slept with. What are you afraid of? The most important thing now is to let Sebastian marry our precious daughter. If Selene had Sebastian‚Äôs child, nobody could bully us again.‚Äù\n\nLincoln sighed and said, ‚ÄúOld Master Ford takes family backgrounds very seriously, I‚Äôm worried that he would dislike Selene for being our adopted daughter.‚Äù\n\nJade laughed with a hint of craziness. ‚ÄúDislike? Sebastian is an illegitimate child. He didn‚Äôt even have the eligibility to inherit the power, but he still managed to take over the whole Ford Group overnight.‚Äù\n\n‚ÄúAs long as Sebastian believes that Selene was the girl who sacrificed her innocence to save him, then nobody could stop them from getting married. Lincoln, you just wait for our precious daughter to marry into South City‚Äôs number one wealthy family and be Sebastian's wife!‚Äù\n\nLincoln nodded happily. \n\nThe sorry feeling that he had for Sabrina disappeared without a trace. \n\nAt that moment, Sabrina had already walked more than 100 meters away. Then, as she was about to turn into the main road, a showy bright-red sportscar blocked her way.\n\nSelene Lynn came down from the car in heels and came to Sabrina arrogantly. ‚ÄúIsn't this the broke woman who had been begging at our house for eight years? Sabrina? How many men have used you, and you still haven‚Äôt showered? Your odor is killing me. Came to beg at my house again? You‚Äôre already selling your body anyway. Why are you still so thick-skinned‚Ä¶‚Äù\n\nSlap! Sabrina raised her wrist and hit Selene right across her face.\n\nSelene instantly had a clear five finger print on her face.\n\nShe touched her face, and put her fingers to her nose and sniffed them. Not surprisingly, they smelled.\n\nShe was filled with anger and roared, ‚ÄúYou‚Ä¶You dare to hit me?‚Äù\n\nSabrina‚Äôs tone was dull and impatient. ‚ÄúIt‚Äôs great now‚îÄ you are just as dirty and smelly as me.‚Äù\n\nShe turned around and left as soon as she finished her words.\n\nHer coldness shocked Selene. Selene was so stunned that she did not chase after Sabrina to fight.\n\nSabrina came to the dirtiest and most seedy place in South City and rented a bed to rest temporarily. \n\nShe wanted to find a job in South City so as to save up some money to return to her hometown, but no employers were willing to hire her because she had been in prison before. In order to get a job, she spent some money to get a fake identification card and assumed the identity of Layla Young. \n\nAfter a few days, she managed to get hired as a waitress at a fine dining restaurant under the pseudonym of Layla Young. The wage was little, but Sabrina was very satisfied.\n\nThree weeks later, she was promoted to be the waitress that was dedicated to serving the VIP rooms because of her hard-working, sweet and gentle appearance. \n\n‚ÄúLayla, differ from the lobby dining area, VIP rooms were filled with esteemed guests. Hence, you have to be careful not to make mistakes.‚Äù The manager called Sabrina by her pseudonym and explained to her carefully.  \n\nSabrina nodded and said, ‚ÄúI know.‚Äù\n\nAnother week passed, she did very well at work. \n\nDuring her spare time, a few other waitresses chatted with Sabrina.\n\n‚ÄúYou‚Äôre so lucky, Layla. You got promoted to serve the VIP rooms in such a short time. However, with your height of 170 centimeters, tiny face, and long legs‚îÄ let alone a promotion to be the VIP room waitress, you would have no problem becoming an air stewardess, model or even enter the entertainment industry.‚Äù\n\nSabrina pursed her lips and walked off with her head bowed.\n\nThe few colleagues extended their warmth but were met with a cold response. So after Sabrina had walked off, they muttered behind her back, ‚ÄúJust a waitress at the VIP Rooms, so arrogant!‚Äù\n\n‚ÄúShe just has a pretty face, who does she think she is?‚Äù\n\n‚ÄúI didn‚Äôt think she was that pretty, maybe just a comely face at best, but her personality was seriously cold and aloof. She has no culture or academic background, but she is so pretentious!‚Äù\n\n‚ÄúShe is not pretentious, just doesn‚Äôt talk much, and she is trustworthy. If you don‚Äôt believe me, look‚Ä¶‚Äù\n\nOne of the colleagues suddenly called for Sabrina, ‚ÄúLayla, my stomach is upset. Could you help send the dishes?‚Äù\n\nSabrina nodded. ‚ÄúNo problem.‚Äù\n\n‚ÄúMy room is the Platinum VIP Room on the third floor, thanks!‚Äù She sped off as soon as the sentence ended.\n\nUnder the shocking gaze of the others, Sabrina went up to the third floor. She took over the dishes from a waitress before she pushed the door open and entered the room. \n\nShe had her head bowed and focused on serving the dishes when her wrist was suddenly caught. Sabrina shuddered and looked up at the customer. She was immediately stunned. \n\nA cold, stern face with a gaze that had an overbearing and arrogant force appeared before her face.  \n\n‚ÄúHow did you know I dine here often?‚Äù Sebastian gripped her hand tightly. His eyes glinted with murderous intent.\nSebastian had been looking for Sabrina for a month.\n \nWhen he thought that Sabrina might not as bad as his investigation, she appeared as the waitress in the room specially dedicated to him.\n \nHe really had underestimated her.\n \n‚ÄúDirector Ford‚Ä¶this, what‚Äôs the matter?‚Äù The restaurant manager who was accompanying Sebastian trembled as he looked at Sebastian.\n \n‚ÄúHow long has she been here?‚Äù Sebastian looked coldly at the manager.\n \n‚ÄúA‚Ä¶A month,‚Äù stuttered the manager.\n \nA month!\n \nIt was exactly the time after she escaped the Ford family.\n \nShe was not trying to escape‚îÄ she only wanted to increase her price.\n \nD*mn!\n \nSabrina looked at Sebastian with resentment and felt wronged.\n \nHow could the world be so small?\n \n‚ÄúI don‚Äôt understand what you‚Äôre saying, let me go! If not, I would call the police.‚Äù She tried her best to free herself from Sebastian‚Äôs restraint, but she could not move at all.\n \nSabrina was in so much pain that a thin layer of sweat started to form on her forehead. \n \nThe manager scolded Sabrina in fright, ‚ÄúLayla Young, you‚Äôve gone too far!‚Äù\n \nSebastian sneered. ‚ÄúLayla Young? You concealed the fact that you were just released from prison by changing your name to Layla Young?‚Äù\n \nAt that moment, the lobby supervisor‚îÄthe same waitress who asked Sabrina to take her place‚îÄrushed over but was too frightened to speak.\n \nSabrina was in despair.\n \nShe only had two days left to collect her paycheck this month. \n \nHowever, everything fell through again.\n \n‚ÄúWhy do you always refuse to leave me alone? Why?!‚Äù Her eyes were instantly redden in anger and frustration. \n\nShe suddenly lifted her wrist and bit Sebastian‚Äôs arm, which made Sebastian release his grip due to pain.\n\nSabrina turned around and ran away as quickly as she could.\n\nShe could not fight with anyone, so she could only run.\n\nWhen Sebastian finally reacted, Sabrina had already run out of the restaurant and quickly got on a bus. She got off after a few stops.\n\nWhen she was walking on the road, she suddenly started bawling uncontrollably.\n\nShe went to prison in Selene‚Äôs place for a month, a dead man took her most precious first time, finally got out of prison with great difficulty but could never see her mother again.\n\nHasn‚Äôt she been unlucky enough?\n\nWhat kind of demon is this man named Ford? Why was he so determined not to let her go?\n\nWhy?!\n\nWas it because she just came out of prison and had no one to rely on, so it looked nice to be bullied?\n\nSabrina bawled until her gut was upset. In the end, she squatted at the roadside and vomited continuously. However, all she vomited was green acidic liquid because she had not eaten.\n\nA woman who had just passed by patted her on her back and said, ‚ÄúGirl, are you experiencing early pregnancy symptoms?‚Äù\n\n‚ÄúEarly pregnancy?‚Äù Sabrina shuddered.\n\nShe had frequently felt nauseated recently, but it never crossed her mind that she could be pregnant. After the reminder from the woman, she suddenly remembered that it had been more than a month since that night.\n\nShe came to the hospital in a panic and held only a few ten dollars in her hands. It was not even enough to do any test.\n\nThe doctor gave Sabrina a test strip to do a urine test.\n\nTen minutes later, the doctor said affirmatively, ‚ÄúYou‚Äôre pregnant.‚Äù\n\nSabrina staggered for a moment. ‚ÄúNo, I can‚Äôt be pregnant.‚Äù\n\n‚ÄúThe pregnancy could be aborted.‚Äù The doctor said coldly and then looked outside. ‚ÄúNext.‚Äù\n\nSabrina walked out of the room, sat by herself on the hospital bench, and felt helpless. \n\n‚ÄúDon‚Äôt cry‚Ä¶Don‚Äôt cry, wipe tears.‚Äù A babbling, cute voice was heard. She looked up and saw a little girl that was still in diapers standing in front of her.\n\nThe little girl raised her chubby little hands to wipe away Sabrina‚Äôs tears but failed. Hence, she patted Sabrina‚Äôs legs to comfort her instead.\n\nSabrina‚Äôs heart instantly melted by what this little girl did.\n\n‚ÄúPlease excuse me, my baby is an amiable and emotional child.‚Äù The young mother stood opposite of Sabrina and smiled.\n\n‚ÄúYour baby is very cute,‚Äù Sabrina replied politely.\n\nShe looked with envy at the mother and daughter as they walked away. She could not help but to touch her lower abdomen. She already had no family. The baby in her belly was her only flesh and blood.\n\nA sense of joy and expectations of being a new mother came all over her.\n\nHowever, what can she use to feed and support the baby?\n\nShe could not even afford the abortion surgery.\n\nEarly morning the following day, Sabrina, with a glimpse of hope, came to the prison and begged the guard. ‚ÄúCan I please see Aunt Grace?‚Äù\n\nWhen Sabrina was first imprisoned, Grace Summer had already been serving in the prison for quite some years. Grace took care of Sabrina and saved her from a lot of trouble. She did not know Grace‚Äôs background, but she could tell that Grace was rich.\n\nEvery month, Grace would receive a lot of money from her visitors.\n\nGrace even gave her a few hundred dollars at the time when Sabrina was released from prison.\n\n‚ÄúGrace Summer had been released for more than a month,‚Äù said the guard as he calculated the time.\n\n‚ÄúWhat?‚Äù Sabrina was surprised.\n\n‚ÄúYou must be Sabrina Scott, right?‚Äù the guard suddenly asked.\n\nSabrina nodded. ‚ÄúThat‚Äôs me.‚Äù\n\n‚ÄúGrace left a number for you when she was released. On that day, you got in a luxurious car as soon as you got out. I shouted for you to stop but you did not hear me.‚Äù\n\nThe guard handed a slip of paper with the phone number written on it to Sabrina.\n\n‚ÄúThank you.‚Äù\n\nTwo hours later, in the VIP ward at the highest-end private hospital in South City, Sabrina met her cellmate, Grace Summer.\n\nGrace‚Äôs eyes were slightly closed as she laid on the bed sickly. However, her grey hair made her look more graceful and elegant.\n\nSabrina could tell that she was a beauty when she was young, but Sabrina did not know why she would be imprisoned.\n\n‚ÄúAunt Grace?‚Äù Sabrina called gently.\n\nGrace gradually opened her eyes. When she saw Sabrina, she was too excited that she started to cough for a while, then calmed down and said, ‚ÄúSabrina, I could finally meet you. I asked that brat to bring you over, but he kept saying you went back to your hometown. You finally returned today. I‚Äôm glad that you are back.‚Äù\n\n‚ÄúI came back from my hometown, Aunt Grace.‚Äù Sabrina lied. She knew the brat that Grace talked about must be her son.\n\nSabrina finally understood why she could be acquitted earlier. It was because Grace‚Äôs son spent a lot of effort to get her out.\n\nThe fact that they were willing to get her out was already quite good. How would they still allow Grace to have such a poverty-stricken friend like her?\n\nThe lie she told Grace about her returning to her hometown was not too much.\n\n‚ÄúI would never forget that I wouldn‚Äôt have survived this long if it weren‚Äôt for your care in prison and I wouldn‚Äôt be able to see my son again.‚Äù Grace was so touched that she cried.\n\nSabrina shook her head, ‚ÄúIt‚Äôs nothing, Aunt Grace. I wasn‚Äôt expecting a reward when I took care of you‚Ä¶‚Äù\n\nAt that moment, she was pondering how to ask ailing Grace for a loan. Finally, she bit her lips as if she had made a decision and said, ‚ÄúAunt Grace, I know I am not supposed to tell you this now, but I really had no choice, I‚Ä¶‚Äù\n\n‚ÄúWhat happened? You‚Äôre here by my side now‚îÄ if you have any difficulties, you can tell me,‚Äù Grace asked.\n\n‚ÄúAunt Grace, could you‚Ä¶loan me some money?‚Äù Sabrina‚Äôs head dropped very low‚îÄ she dared not look at her.\n\n‚ÄúHow much do you want? I‚Äôll give you.‚Äù A gentle voice could be heard from behind her.\n\nSabrina quickly turned her head and was so shocked that she could not speak smoothly. ‚ÄúHow could it be you?‚Äù"

        "Sabrina Scott walked out of prison before dusk fell.\n\nShe had been temporarily bailed out of jail for one day.\n\nHolding a slip of paper with an address on it in her hand, she took a bus at the gate of the prison. She arrived at an old mansion halfway up the mountain when it was almost nightfall. The doorman then led Sabrina into a bedroom.\n\nThe bedroom was pitch black, and she smelled thick, pungent blood as soon as she entered.\n\nBefore she had adapted herself to the darkness in the room, a pair of strong arms grabbed her and she fell into a man‚Äôs embrace.\n \nA hot breath blew by her ear. ‚ÄúSo, you are what they sent for me to enjoy before my death, the‚Ä¶ call girl?‚Äù\n \n‚ÄòCall... girl?‚Äô \n \nSabrina‚Äôs tears came rolling down her eyes. \n \nShe suddenly felt frightened, and her voice trembled. ‚ÄúAre you‚Ä¶ dying soon?‚Äù\n \n‚ÄúYes! Do you regret doing my business?‚Äù The man sneered faintly.\n \n‚ÄúI don‚Äôt regret it,‚Äù Sabrina said miserably.\n \nShe had no room for regret because her mother was waiting to be saved by her.\n \nAlthough she could not see the man‚Äôs face in the darkness, she could feel the man did not seem like somebody who is dying.\n\nA couple of hours later, the man finally fell asleep.\n \n‚ÄòIs he dead already?‚Äô\n \nSabrina had no time to be in fear, and she quickly fled the mansion.\n \nAt that time, the night sky began to rain heavily. She ran in the rain to the Lynn Residence.\n \nIt was eleven o‚Äôclock at night and the door to the Lynn Residence was locked. However, Sabrina could hear the joyful noise in the house as if there was something worth celebrating.\n \n‚ÄúOpen the door! Quickly, open the door and give me the money. I need to go save my mother‚Ä¶ Open the door! Open the door!‚Äù\n \nThe door was still locked.\n \nShe was muddle-headed and was a little unsteady on her feet at this point because she had waited for the bus in the rain for a long time before she had to run to Lynn Residence. However, she had to brace herself up and kept banging hard on the door of Lynn Residence. ‚ÄúOpen the door! Open the door! Quickly give me the money, I need to go save my mother‚Ä¶‚Äù \n \n‚ÄòBang!‚Äô The door was pushed open from inside, and Sabrina‚Äôs despaired gaze suddenly sparkled.\n \nThe person behind the door looked at Sabrina with contempt and disgust. \n \nSabrina knew that she looked worse than a beggar now.\n \nHowever, she could not care for her image now. She rushed up and looked at the person with a pleading look in her eyes. ‚ÄúI have done what you asked me to do, quickly give me the money, my mother‚Äôs life cannot wait any longer, please‚Ä¶‚Äù\n \n‚ÄúYour mother is dead, so you no longer need the money.‚Äù The person who opened the door threw a black-framed picture into the rain, then mercilessly closed the door.\n \n‚ÄúWhat?‚Äù Sabrina was stupefied as she stood motionless in the heavy rain. \n \nLong long afterward, she let out a harsh cry, ‚ÄúMother‚Ä¶‚Äù\n \n‚ÄúMother‚Ä¶I was late, wasn‚Äôt I? I missed the timing to save you, didn‚Äôt I? My mother is dead‚Ä¶My mother is dead‚Ä¶‚Äù Sabrina hugged her mother‚Äôs coffin portrait, curled up in the rain, and muttered to herself.\n \nShe then crawled up and started to bang on the door like a crazy person. ‚ÄúLiar! I‚Äôve done what I‚Äôve promised you, but you didn‚Äôt save my mother, return my mother to me! Liar! Your whole family will die horribly‚Ä¶ Liar! Liar! Liar! I curse that your whole family will have a terrible death!‚Äù\n \nSabrina fainted for crying too much outside the door of the Lynn Residence.\n \nWhen she woke up, three days had passed, and she was in prison again. \n \nShe was sent to the medical care area when she was in a coma because she had a high fever. Her fever came down after three days, and she was returned to the original imprisonment area.\n \nA few female inmates came and surrounded her. \n \n‚ÄúI thought she was released and freed after being bailed out, but she was sent back in again just after three days?‚Äù\n \n‚ÄúI heard she was lent out to be toyed with for a night.‚Äù\n \nThe well-built female gang leader pulled Sabrina‚Äôs hair and let out a burst of sinister laughter. ‚ÄúWhat a good life this woman had! Watch me beat her to death today!‚Äù\n \nSabrina did not even bat an eyelid.\n \nLet them beat her to death. If she were beaten to death, it would be perfect for her to reunite with her mother. \n \nAs the women started to strip Sabrina‚Äôs clothing, a stern voice came from the door. ‚ÄúWhat are you doing?‚Äù \n \nThe female gang leader instantly put on a fake smile. ‚ÄúSabrina was sick. We were just concern for her.‚Äù\n \nThe correctional officer did not answer but shouted Sabrina‚Äôs prison code. ‚Äú036, come out!‚Äù\n \nSabrina walked out and asked indifferently, ‚ÄúWhat did I do wrong now?‚Äù\n \n‚ÄúYou have been acquitted.‚Äù The correctional officer said blankly. \n \n‚ÄúWhat?‚Äù Sabrina thought she hallucinated. It was until when she was out of the prison door that she realized it was real. \n \nShe cried tears of joy and murmured, ‚ÄúMother! I couldn‚Äôt save you, but could you forgive me? I will see you now. Where are you buried‚Ä¶?‚Äù\n \n‚ÄúAre you Miss Scott?‚Äù a man‚Äôs voice came coldly, and then a man in a suit stood before Sabrina. Right behind the man, there was a black car stopped. Sabrina could vaguely see a man with shades was watching her from the car.\n \nShe nodded. ‚ÄúYes, that‚Äôs me. You‚Ä¶‚Äù\n \nThe man did not answer but turned around and spoke politely to the man in shades seated in the car. ‚ÄúYoung Master Sebastian, it‚Äôs her.‚Äù\n \n‚ÄúBring her over!‚Äù The man in shades ordered.\n \nSabrina, who was still confused, was pushed into the car and sat next to the man in shades. She immediately felt a cold murderous aura coming from him.\n \nSabrina felt her life was in his hands.\n \n‚ÄúI am Sebastian Ford.‚Äù The man introduced himself coldly.\n \nSabrina could not help but shivered and asked gently, ‚ÄúI have not been acquitted‚Ä¶but I am going to receive my death sentence, right?‚Äù\n \n‚ÄúI‚Äôm taking you to get a marriage certificate!‚Äù Sebastian was reluctant to even look at her once more. \n \nSabrina suddenly thought his voice was familiar. It sounded like the man that died that night. \n \nHowever, the man had died.\n \n‚ÄúWhat did you say?‚Äù She thought she had heard it wrong.\nSebastian did not look at Sabrina. ‚ÄúYou heard me.‚Äù\n\nSabrina fiddled with the edges of her filthy clothes and said in a soft voice, ‚ÄúSir, this joke is not funny at all.‚Äù\n\nSebastian sneered and said sharply, ‚ÄúWasn‚Äôt it your plan to be married to me all along?‚Äù\n\nSebastian‚Äôs gaze cut through Sabrina‚Äôs thin sunken face like a sharp razor and stared into her eyes. Sabrina shuddered and turned her head away, but Sebastian squeezed her chin and forced her to look at him. \n\nSabrina then realized that the features under the shades had a cool and beautiful outline. God definitely favored him because he looked so handsome. Moreover, that black stubble on his jawline exuded incomparable rugged masculinity. \n\nHis suit was well-tailored and looked luxurious. \n\nSabrina could tell this man was a very distinguished person.\n\nIn contrast, she was wearing worn out clothes covered in mold, with disheveled hair and dirty face. Moreover, her body was smelly because she had not showered for days. \n\nThe two of them were going to get a marriage certificate?\n\nSabrina lowered her gaze and said softly, ‚ÄúSir, do you think because I have been in jail for two years and had not seen any man, I would simply marry any random ugly man, even if I had not met him before?‚Äù\n\nSebastian could not help but took another look at her. \n\nShe was quite young, but had a sharp tongue, and was extraordinarily calm. His disgust towards her inevitably increased. ‚ÄúAre you deliberately using this method to anger me and to arouse my interest in you?‚Äù \n\nAs soon as he finished, he did not wait for Sabrina to answer but immediately ordered the driver, ‚ÄúTo the city hall!‚Äù\n\n‚ÄúLet me go! I don‚Äôt even know you!‚Äù Sabrina was horrified and wanted to get out of the car. \n\nWith a backhand motion, Sebastian pinned her against the seat with his elbow, glared at her with a sinister gaze, and said in a cold voice, ‚ÄúWoman, listen up! You will be dead if you dare to get off the car.‚Äù\n\nSabrina was scared. She had tears tumbling in her eyes, and she said in a weak voice, ‚ÄúI‚Ä¶don‚Äôt want to die.‚Äù\n\n‚ÄúTo the city hall!‚Äù The man ordered again. \n\n‚ÄúYoung Master Sebastian, do we go straight to the city hall?‚Äù asked the assistant in the front passenger seat. \n\nSebastian looked puzzled.\n\nThe assistant looked at Sabrina and said bluntly, ‚ÄúYoung Mistress‚Äô clothes are worn and old, and she looked dirty‚Ä¶‚Äù\n\n‚ÄúReturn to the Ford Residence!‚Äù The man gave another order.\n\n‚ÄúYes, Master Sebastian.‚Äù The driver started the engine. \n\nOne and half hours later, the car stopped. \n\nSabrina got out of the car and saw the grand mansion that was the Ford Residence. It was located halfway up the mountain. \n\nThere was a world of difference compared to the mansion located halfway up another mountain that she had seen three days ago. This looked like a palace, whereas the mansion from three days ago was like a dilapidated prison. The man that took her innocence would probably be a death row inmate. \n\nShe was still lost in her thoughts when Sebastian grabbed her wrist.\n\nWhen he pulled her along and strode forward, she had to jog behind like a stray puppy because she was much shorter than him.\n\nThe maids in the mansion bowed politely upon seeing the man. ‚ÄúWelcome back, Young Master Sebastian.‚Äù\n\nThe man led Sabrina through the main house towards the low-levelled rooms in the yard. He handed Sabrina to a few maids and said, ‚ÄúFind some clean clothes for her, and let her take a bath.‚Äù\n\n‚ÄúYes, Master Sebastian.‚Äù The maids answered and brought Sabrina to the bathroom.\n\nShe must escape from here.\n\nShe could not be with a man that wished to have her killed but still wanted to get the marriage certificate with her right after she came out from prison. \n\nSabrina was so deep in her thoughts that she did not realize the maids had already taken most of her clothes off. \n\nThe maids sighed together.\n\n‚ÄúThose bruises on her neck seemed to be love bites?‚Äù\n\nWhen Sabrina had regained her focus, she frantically bit her lips and said, ‚ÄúI‚Äôm not used to others bathing me. Please leave, and I will bathe myself.‚Äù\n\nOne of the maids asked, ‚ÄúYou are Young Master Sebastian‚Äôs‚Ä¶‚Äù\n\nSabrina quickly interjected and said, ‚ÄúMaid.‚Äù\n\n‚ÄúBathe yourself then.‚Äù The maids turned around and left impolitely. \n\nWhen they went out, one of the maids let out a cold snort in a sarcastic way, ‚ÄúI thought she was Young Master Sebastian‚Äôs woman. She turned out to be only a maid. She looked like a promiscuous thing. Who did she think she was to let us bath her?‚Äù \n\nWhen the maid looked up, she saw Sebastian standing right outside the bathroom. The maid immediately shut her mouth in fear. \n\nIn the bathroom, Sabrina looked at herself in the mirror with her face flushed red.\n\nHer most precious first time was taken by a man whom she had never even met. In addition, she would never know what he looked like forever. \n\nShe shut her eyes, and tears glided from her cheeks to her neck.\n\n‚ÄúYou really are a filthy woman!‚Äù said a harsh male voice. \n\nSabrina opened her eyes in a panic.\n\nSebastian was looking at her neck with disgust.\n\nSabrina frantically covered herself with her clothes. The tears of anger and shame came sliding down her face. ‚ÄúI was just released from prison, and you kidnapped me here. I don‚Äôt know you. No matter how filthy I am, it has nothing to do with you, right? Please get out!‚Äù\n\nSebastian‚Äôs disgusted gaze landed on Sabrina‚Äôs face, but he could not identify her tell that showed that she was acting.\n\nThis woman truly was a skilled swindler. \n\n‚ÄúFollow me to get our marriage certificate once you‚Äôre done washing up. Three months later, I would divorce you, then pay you a certain amount of money. When that time comes, if you wished to stay beside me for even one more second, it would not be possible!‚Äù Once he finished his sentence, he closed the door and left.\n\nThe maids in the yard dared not breathe too loudly because Sebastian was present. \n\nFour days ago, at this house, all the maids had witnessed how vicious and domineering this newly appointed head of the Ford family can be.\n\nSebastian was the fourth son of his father, and his father was the eldest son of the Ford family. His three brothers and him were not born by the same mother. He was an illegitimate son. Although the Ford family was a century-old noble family, a b*stard like Sebastian would not have the eligibility to inherit even a tiny portion of the Ford family‚Äôs fortune.\n\nIn the Ford family, the collateral descendants even had priority over him for inheritance. \n\nWhen he was a teenager, he had been driven into exile. However, he finally fought his way back one day and managed to return to his country, but his mother was framed and imprisoned.\n\nSince then, Sebastian had been calculating every step meticulously and executing his plan in secret.\n\nFinally, he faked his death three days ago and engaged a counterattack.\n\nAs a result, he drove his opponents to an end and had successfully gained control over the whole Ford family. \n\nIn the current Ford family, Sebastian has the final say. \n\nSebastian could only feel coldness in his gut whenever he recalled his past. \n\nHis mother did not willingly become the third person in his father‚Äôs marriage. It was a trick used by his father‚Äôs wife to keep his father in their marriage. \n\nWhen Sebastian‚Äôs mother found out that his father had a family, she was already nine months pregnant.\n\nIn order to let her son grow up in the company of parents, his mother had no choice but to stay by his father‚Äôs side and suffered humiliation in silence. She was even framed and imprisoned when she was in her middle age. When Sebastian finally gained control of the Ford family and got his mother out of prison, she only had three months to live.\n\nHis mother only had one wish. She wanted him to take her cellmate, Sabrina Scott, as his bride.\n\nSebastian could only obey her wish, seeing that his mother did not have much time left.\n\nThe night before he decided to take Sabrina out of prison, he had done a thorough investigation on her.\n\nHis investigation showed that this woman had an ulterior motive for getting close to his mother.\n\n‚ÄúSomething‚Äôs wrong, Young Master Sebastian!‚Äù The maid‚Äôs frightened exclamation interrupted his thoughts.\n\nSebastian‚Äôs gaze instantly turned serious. ‚ÄúWhat are you panicking about?‚Äù\n\n‚ÄúThat woman‚Ä¶ escaped by jumping out of the window,‚Äù the maid said in fear.\n‚ÄúWhat?‚Äù A frown instantly formed on Sebastian‚Äôs face, and he immediately rushed in the bathroom. \n\nThere was nobody in the bathroom, but on the wall, a line of words written in blood was left. ‚ÄòMr. Ford, despite our substantial differences in terms of social status, I wouldn‚Äôt want to marry you, farewell!‚Äô\n\nThe handwriting was neat and sharp, which revealed the writer‚Äôs unyielding trait. \n\nSebastian was stunned by it.\n\nCould his investigation result on her be wrong?\n\nA few seconds later, he gave an order. ‚ÄúSearch the back of the mountain!‚Äù\n\nHe could not let his mother have any regrets before she died.\n\nAt the back of the mountain, holding onto thorns and vines to go down, Sabrina managed to escape the search from the Ford family by hiding under a dense vine, despite having her clothes torn.\n\nShe stayed there till nightfall and went around the mountain by climbing over.\n\nEarly morning on the following day, she went to the Lynn Residence again. Lincoln Lynn and Jade Sullivan were shocked and panicked when they saw Sabrina.\n\n‚ÄúYou, how did you escape from prison?‚Äù Jade asked with a guilty expression.\n\nSabrina said mockingly, ‚ÄúMrs. Lynn, I have been released after serving my full sentence.‚Äù\n\n‚ÄúYou still shouldn‚Äôt have come to our house. You‚Äôre dirty and smelly, it‚Äôs too pungent! Get out of here quickly!‚Äù Jade forcefully chased Sabrina out of the house.\n\nSabrina could not be bothered to even look at Jade. She only looked at Lincoln and asked, ‚ÄúUncle Lynn, your family knew very well why I was imprisoned back then, right? Four days ago, you came to visit me in jail and told me if I followed the address given and stayed with a man for a night, you would give me a sum to save my mother. So, I stayed with that man, but my mother died.‚Äù\n\nLincoln felt guilty but argued, ‚ÄúEveryone has their fate! I was kind and wanted to save your mother, but your mother died too soon! Could you blame me for that?‚Äù\n\nSabrina glared furiously at Lincoln. \n\nShe had to pierce her nails into her flesh, only then could she suppress her urge to rush up to Lincoln and bite him to death. This is because she did not have the capabilities to investigate whether her mother‚Äôs death had any relations to the Lynn family yet.\n\nShe gritted her teeth and asked calmly, ‚ÄúWhere was my mother buried?‚Äù\n\nLincoln answered in vague tone, ‚ÄúOf course she was buried in the soil cemetery back at your hometown! I have paid for your living expenses and studies for eight years. Do I still need to buy a premium cemetery plot for your mother? You ungrateful person, leave now!‚Äù\n\nAs Lincoln closed the door, he tossed a thousand dollars and said, ‚ÄúThis was for your service that night.‚Äù\n\nA stab in Sabrina‚Äôs heart could be felt every time that night was mentioned.\n\nEven she felt miserable, she still raised her chin high and stubbornly said, ‚ÄúIf someone had to pay, shouldn‚Äôt it be that man who needed to pay me? Since he is dead, then there is no use for it! Besides, I'm not a call girl! The reason I promised you was, firstly, to save my mother, and secondly, to repay your kindness for nurturing me. So from now on, our debt is cleared!‚Äù\n\nEight years living under the Lynn family‚Äôs fence was enough!\n\nShe would never return to the Lynn family in the future.\n\nIf she were to be back, it would be to avenge her mother.\n\nAs he watched a tattered-looking Sabrina leave the house with such determination, Lincoln suddenly felt a dull pain on his chest.\n\nJade immediately scolded him furiously, ‚ÄúWhy? Do you feel sorry for her and her mother? Lincoln Lynn, don‚Äôt forget she cursed my daughter to death! They were born on the same day. Why does she get to live, and my daughter died right after birth?‚Äù\n\nLincoln said, ‚ÄúI‚Ä¶ I am not feeling sorry for her. The most important thing now is that she is out of prison. If she knew the man that she had slept with did not die but became the head of the Ford family, then we are going to be in big trouble!‚Äù\n\nJade sneered and said, ‚ÄúShe didn‚Äôt even know who she slept with. What are you afraid of? The most important thing now is to let Sebastian marry our precious daughter. If Selene had Sebastian‚Äôs child, nobody could bully us again.‚Äù\n\nLincoln sighed and said, ‚ÄúOld Master Ford takes family backgrounds very seriously, I‚Äôm worried that he would dislike Selene for being our adopted daughter.‚Äù\n\nJade laughed with a hint of craziness. ‚ÄúDislike? Sebastian is an illegitimate child. He didn‚Äôt even have the eligibility to inherit the power, but he still managed to take over the whole Ford Group overnight.‚Äù\n\n‚ÄúAs long as Sebastian believes that Selene was the girl who sacrificed her innocence to save him, then nobody could stop them from getting married. Lincoln, you just wait for our precious daughter to marry into South City‚Äôs number one wealthy family and be Sebastian's wife!‚Äù\n\nLincoln nodded happily. \n\nThe sorry feeling that he had for Sabrina disappeared without a trace. \n\nAt that moment, Sabrina had already walked more than 100 meters away. Then, as she was about to turn into the main road, a showy bright-red sportscar blocked her way.\n\nSelene Lynn came down from the car in heels and came to Sabrina arrogantly. ‚ÄúIsn't this the broke woman who had been begging at our house for eight years? Sabrina? How many men have used you, and you still haven‚Äôt showered? Your odor is killing me. Came to beg at my house again? You‚Äôre already selling your body anyway. Why are you still so thick-skinned‚Ä¶‚Äù\n\nSlap! Sabrina raised her wrist and hit Selene right across her face.\n\nSelene instantly had a clear five finger print on her face.\n\nShe touched her face, and put her fingers to her nose and sniffed them. Not surprisingly, they smelled.\n\nShe was filled with anger and roared, ‚ÄúYou‚Ä¶You dare to hit me?‚Äù\n\nSabrina‚Äôs tone was dull and impatient. ‚ÄúIt‚Äôs great now‚îÄ you are just as dirty and smelly as me.‚Äù\n\nShe turned around and left as soon as she finished her words.\n\nHer coldness shocked Selene. Selene was so stunned that she did not chase after Sabrina to fight.\n\nSabrina came to the dirtiest and most seedy place in South City and rented a bed to rest temporarily. \n\nShe wanted to find a job in South City so as to save up some money to return to her hometown, but no employers were willing to hire her because she had been in prison before. In order to get a job, she spent some money to get a fake identification card and assumed the identity of Layla Young. \n\nAfter a few days, she managed to get hired as a waitress at a fine dining restaurant under the pseudonym of Layla Young. The wage was little, but Sabrina was very satisfied.\n\nThree weeks later, she was promoted to be the waitress that was dedicated to serving the VIP rooms because of her hard-working, sweet and gentle appearance. \n\n‚ÄúLayla, differ from the lobby dining area, VIP rooms were filled with esteemed guests. Hence, you have to be careful not to make mistakes.‚Äù The manager called Sabrina by her pseudonym and explained to her carefully.  \n\nSabrina nodded and said, ‚ÄúI know.‚Äù\n\nAnother week passed, she did very well at work. \n\nDuring her spare time, a few other waitresses chatted with Sabrina.\n\n‚ÄúYou‚Äôre so lucky, Layla. You got promoted to serve the VIP rooms in such a short time. However, with your height of 170 centimeters, tiny face, and long legs‚îÄ let alone a promotion to be the VIP room waitress, you would have no problem becoming an air stewardess, model or even enter the entertainment industry.‚Äù\n\nSabrina pursed her lips and walked off with her head bowed.\n\nThe few colleagues extended their warmth but were met with a cold response. So after Sabrina had walked off, they muttered behind her back, ‚ÄúJust a waitress at the VIP Rooms, so arrogant!‚Äù\n\n‚ÄúShe just has a pretty face, who does she think she is?‚Äù\n\n‚ÄúI didn‚Äôt think she was that pretty, maybe just a comely face at best, but her personality was seriously cold and aloof. She has no culture or academic background, but she is so pretentious!‚Äù\n\n‚ÄúShe is not pretentious, just doesn‚Äôt talk much, and she is trustworthy. If you don‚Äôt believe me, look‚Ä¶‚Äù\n\nOne of the colleagues suddenly called for Sabrina, ‚ÄúLayla, my stomach is upset. Could you help send the dishes?‚Äù\n\nSabrina nodded. ‚ÄúNo problem.‚Äù\n\n‚ÄúMy room is the Platinum VIP Room on the third floor, thanks!‚Äù She sped off as soon as the sentence ended.\n\nUnder the shocking gaze of the others, Sabrina went up to the third floor. She took over the dishes from a waitress before she pushed the door open and entered the room. \n\nShe had her head bowed and focused on serving the dishes when her wrist was suddenly caught. Sabrina shuddered and looked up at the customer. She was immediately stunned. \n\nA cold, stern face with a gaze that had an overbearing and arrogant force appeared before her face.  \n\n‚ÄúHow did you know I dine here often?‚Äù Sebastian gripped her hand tightly. His eyes glinted with murderous intent.\nSebastian had been looking for Sabrina for a month.\n \nWhen he thought that Sabrina might not as bad as his investigation, she appeared as the waitress in the room specially dedicated to him.\n \nHe really had underestimated her.\n \n‚ÄúDirector Ford‚Ä¶this, what‚Äôs the matter?‚Äù The restaurant manager who was accompanying Sebastian trembled as he looked at Sebastian.\n \n‚ÄúHow long has she been here?‚Äù Sebastian looked coldly at the manager.\n \n‚ÄúA‚Ä¶A month,‚Äù stuttered the manager.\n \nA month!\n \nIt was exactly the time after she escaped the Ford family.\n \nShe was not trying to escape‚îÄ she only wanted to increase her price.\n \nD*mn!\n \nSabrina looked at Sebastian with resentment and felt wronged.\n \nHow could the world be so small?\n \n‚ÄúI don‚Äôt understand what you‚Äôre saying, let me go! If not, I would call the police.‚Äù She tried her best to free herself from Sebastian‚Äôs restraint, but she could not move at all.\n \nSabrina was in so much pain that a thin layer of sweat started to form on her forehead. \n \nThe manager scolded Sabrina in fright, ‚ÄúLayla Young, you‚Äôve gone too far!‚Äù\n \nSebastian sneered. ‚ÄúLayla Young? You concealed the fact that you were just released from prison by changing your name to Layla Young?‚Äù\n \nAt that moment, the lobby supervisor‚îÄthe same waitress who asked Sabrina to take her place‚îÄrushed over but was too frightened to speak.\n \nSabrina was in despair.\n \nShe only had two days left to collect her paycheck this month. \n \nHowever, everything fell through again.\n \n‚ÄúWhy do you always refuse to leave me alone? Why?!‚Äù Her eyes were instantly redden in anger and frustration. \n\nShe suddenly lifted her wrist and bit Sebastian‚Äôs arm, which made Sebastian release his grip due to pain.\n\nSabrina turned around and ran away as quickly as she could.\n\nShe could not fight with anyone, so she could only run.\n\nWhen Sebastian finally reacted, Sabrina had already run out of the restaurant and quickly got on a bus. She got off after a few stops.\n\nWhen she was walking on the road, she suddenly started bawling uncontrollably.\n\nShe went to prison in Selene‚Äôs place for a month, a dead man took her most precious first time, finally got out of prison with great difficulty but could never see her mother again.\n\nHasn‚Äôt she been unlucky enough?\n\nWhat kind of demon is this man named Ford? Why was he so determined not to let her go?\n\nWhy?!\n\nWas it because she just came out of prison and had no one to rely on, so it looked nice to be bullied?\n\nSabrina bawled until her gut was upset. In the end, she squatted at the roadside and vomited continuously. However, all she vomited was green acidic liquid because she had not eaten.\n\nA woman who had just passed by patted her on her back and said, ‚ÄúGirl, are you experiencing early pregnancy symptoms?‚Äù\n\n‚ÄúEarly pregnancy?‚Äù Sabrina shuddered.\n\nShe had frequently felt nauseated recently, but it never crossed her mind that she could be pregnant. After the reminder from the woman, she suddenly remembered that it had been more than a month since that night.\n\nShe came to the hospital in a panic and held only a few ten dollars in her hands. It was not even enough to do any test.\n\nThe doctor gave Sabrina a test strip to do a urine test.\n\nTen minutes later, the doctor said affirmatively, ‚ÄúYou‚Äôre pregnant.‚Äù\n\nSabrina staggered for a moment. ‚ÄúNo, I can‚Äôt be pregnant.‚Äù\n\n‚ÄúThe pregnancy could be aborted.‚Äù The doctor said coldly and then looked outside. ‚ÄúNext.‚Äù\n\nSabrina walked out of the room, sat by herself on the hospital bench, and felt helpless. \n\n‚ÄúDon‚Äôt cry‚Ä¶Don‚Äôt cry, wipe tears.‚Äù A babbling, cute voice was heard. She looked up and saw a little girl that was still in diapers standing in front of her.\n\nThe little girl raised her chubby little hands to wipe away Sabrina‚Äôs tears but failed. Hence, she patted Sabrina‚Äôs legs to comfort her instead.\n\nSabrina‚Äôs heart instantly melted by what this little girl did.\n\n‚ÄúPlease excuse me, my baby is an amiable and emotional child.‚Äù The young mother stood opposite of Sabrina and smiled.\n\n‚ÄúYour baby is very cute,‚Äù Sabrina replied politely.\n\nShe looked with envy at the mother and daughter as they walked away. She could not help but to touch her lower abdomen. She already had no family. The baby in her belly was her only flesh and blood.\n\nA sense of joy and expectations of being a new mother came all over her.\n\nHowever, what can she use to feed and support the baby?\n\nShe could not even afford the abortion surgery.\n\nEarly morning the following day, Sabrina, with a glimpse of hope, came to the prison and begged the guard. ‚ÄúCan I please see Aunt Grace?‚Äù\n\nWhen Sabrina was first imprisoned, Grace Summer had already been serving in the prison for quite some years. Grace took care of Sabrina and saved her from a lot of trouble. She did not know Grace‚Äôs background, but she could tell that Grace was rich.\n\nEvery month, Grace would receive a lot of money from her visitors.\n\nGrace even gave her a few hundred dollars at the time when Sabrina was released from prison.\n\n‚ÄúGrace Summer had been released for more than a month,‚Äù said the guard as he calculated the time.\n\n‚ÄúWhat?‚Äù Sabrina was surprised.\n\n‚ÄúYou must be Sabrina Scott, right?‚Äù the guard suddenly asked.\n\nSabrina nodded. ‚ÄúThat‚Äôs me.‚Äù\n\n‚ÄúGrace left a number for you when she was released. On that day, you got in a luxurious car as soon as you got out. I shouted for you to stop but you did not hear me.‚Äù\n\nThe guard handed a slip of paper with the phone number written on it to Sabrina.\n\n‚ÄúThank you.‚Äù\n\nTwo hours later, in the VIP ward at the highest-end private hospital in South City, Sabrina met her cellmate, Grace Summer.\n\nGrace‚Äôs eyes were slightly closed as she laid on the bed sickly. However, her grey hair made her look more graceful and elegant.\n\nSabrina could tell that she was a beauty when she was young, but Sabrina did not know why she would be imprisoned.\n\n‚ÄúAunt Grace?‚Äù Sabrina called gently.\n\nGrace gradually opened her eyes. When she saw Sabrina, she was too excited that she started to cough for a while, then calmed down and said, ‚ÄúSabrina, I could finally meet you. I asked that brat to bring you over, but he kept saying you went back to your hometown. You finally returned today. I‚Äôm glad that you are back.‚Äù\n\n‚ÄúI came back from my hometown, Aunt Grace.‚Äù Sabrina lied. She knew the brat that Grace talked about must be her son.\n\nSabrina finally understood why she could be acquitted earlier. It was because Grace‚Äôs son spent a lot of effort to get her out.\n\nThe fact that they were willing to get her out was already quite good. How would they still allow Grace to have such a poverty-stricken friend like her?\n\nThe lie she told Grace about her returning to her hometown was not too much.\n\n‚ÄúI would never forget that I wouldn‚Äôt have survived this long if it weren‚Äôt for your care in prison and I wouldn‚Äôt be able to see my son again.‚Äù Grace was so touched that she cried.\n\nSabrina shook her head, ‚ÄúIt‚Äôs nothing, Aunt Grace. I wasn‚Äôt expecting a reward when I took care of you‚Ä¶‚Äù\n\nAt that moment, she was pondering how to ask ailing Grace for a loan. Finally, she bit her lips as if she had made a decision and said, ‚ÄúAunt Grace, I know I am not supposed to tell you this now, but I really had no choice, I‚Ä¶‚Äù\n\n‚ÄúWhat happened? You‚Äôre here by my side now‚îÄ if you have any difficulties, you can tell me,‚Äù Grace asked.\n\n‚ÄúAunt Grace, could you‚Ä¶loan me some money?‚Äù Sabrina‚Äôs head dropped very low‚îÄ she dared not look at her.\n\n‚ÄúHow much do you want? I‚Äôll give you.‚Äù A gentle voice could be heard from behind her.\n\nSabrina quickly turned her head and was so shocked that she could not speak smoothly. ‚ÄúHow could it be you?‚Äù"

        "\"You're already married! Why are you here to register again?!\n\"Don't you realize it's a crime to be a bigamist?\"\n‚Ä¶\nKeira Olsen, startled, stepped out of the Civil Affairs Bureau, holding a just-printed marriage certificate.\nThe man who had accompanied her here to register looked at the stunning woman and lamented, \"Miss Olsen, you're already married. Why did you hire me for a sham wedding?\"\nAfter saying that the deposit was non-refundable, he left in a hurry.\nKeira bit her lip, still reeling from the shock.\nShe'd never even had a boyfriend. How could she possibly be married?!\nShe lowered her head to look at the printout in her hands.\nIn the certificate photo, the girl appeared a bit constrained with a forced smile. The mole on the corner of her eye proved that it was indeed her. As for the man...\nHe had heavy features and a prominent nose. His thin lips curved into a faint smile as he stared into the camera lens intently as if they were piercing through the paper.\nHis mystery and commanding presence couldn't be concealed, even in a black-and-white photo.\nShe then looked at his name: Lewis Horton.\nShe was certain she never met this man!\nWhat on earth was going on?!\nKeira took out her phone, snapped a picture of the certificate, opened WhatsApp, and sent it to a contact with a black avatar. \"Help me figure out who this is.\"\nShe got an instant reply. \"Got it.\"\nOnly then did Keira momentarily set aside her confusion. She climbed onto her old electric scooter and slowly rode into an upscale villa area, returning to the Olsen family.\nToday was her older sister, Isla Olsen's, big day. Her future husband was coming over for the betrothal.\nThe house was brilliantly decorated with servants busying about in an orderly fashion. A few temp workers had also been hired for the occasion.\nKeira parked her scooter in a corner and heard the chatter of the temp workers and servants she passed by.\n\"Who is she? She's so pretty!\"\n\"Shush, she's the illegitimate daughter that the Boss doesn't acknowledge.\"\n\"Her mom was the mistress. When Mrs. Olsen was about to give birth, she showed up heavily pregnant, demanding rights, and they both delivered on the same day. That old woman has got balls. She has made up all sorts of excuses and not left the house.\"\n\"At least Miss Keira knows her place. She moved out in junior high and hasn't been back for many years. I wonder what brings her here today...\"\nKeira kept her gaze lowered, pretending not to hear their talk, and walked into the living room.\nHer mother, Poppy Hill, was waiting at the door. The woman, still elegant at such an age, anxiously pulled her upstairs as soon as she entered the house. \"Come with me to see your sister. By the way, did you get the marriage certificate?\"\nThere was no emotion in Keira's voice. \"Yes.\"\nIt was technically true, even though the groom was someone else.\n\"That's good. You have to remember your place. Jake Horton is your sister's fianc√©. He's from a high-ranking noble family, something an illegitimate child like you could never hope for! Only your sister is worthy of him!\"\nHearing these words, a touch of mockery flashed in Keira's eyes.\nJake Horton, the legitimate grandson of the first branch of Oceanion's preeminent Horton family, pursued her for four years in college, only to propose to Isla on graduation day...\nUpon learning about the proposal, Poppy demanded Keira to immediately find someone else to marry, extinguishing any potential between her and Jake.\nThat's how it had always been...\nWhenever there was even the slightest chance of a conflict of interest between her and Isla, Poppy would demand her to unconditionally give way.\nBecause she was the illegitimate daughter, her mere existence was a sin.\nAs a child, she was brainwashed into believing that undergoing all those hardships was a natural thing.\nBut now she was no longer oblivious.\nKeira's expression was solemn as she stressed each word, \"We agreed. This is the last time.\"\nPoppy was the culprit. She was the one who clung to the Olsen family day after day just to see her man, and she was the one who wanted to appease Isla. Keira wouldn't ruin her own life for Poppy's sake.\nToday's event was to repay Poppy for giving birth to her. After that, they were even.\nPoppy sounded annoyed. \"I heard you.\"\nIn the middle of their conversation, they arrived at Isla's room.\nThe pretty girl was like a princess in her stunning dress. She was sitting on the sofa selecting her jewelry, and the room was filled with the glamorous sparkle of gemstones.\nKeira, dressed simply, maintained her straight posture despite the contrast.\nIsla greeted her upon seeing her. \"Keira, what brings you here?\"\nBefore Keira could answer, Poppy interjected, \"Isla, Keira got married today.\"\nIsla was surprised. \"So soon? Who's the guy? Is he better than Jake?\"\nPoppy said in a mocking tone, \"Of course not! There isn't a single person in all of Oceanion of higher standing than young Mr. Horton! Isla, do you really think she could find a decent suitor? The loser she married didn't even dare to come here with her. He's afraid that his poverty-stricken appearance will offend your sight!\"\nIsla asked with a hint of jealousy, \"How can that be? Keira's so pretty; otherwise Jake wouldn't have pursued her for four years.\"\n\"What's the use of being pretty? A shabby shoe will only match a ragged sock. Given her status, only the scum of society would marry her. Young Mr. Horton merely saw her as a toy and a passing amusement. Only you, Isla, with your status, are a match for young Mr. Horton‚Ä¶\"\nKeira frowned.\nThe man in the photo, with his looks and presence, didn't seem to correspond with Poppy's description of a ghetto husband and scum at all.\nBut she couldn't be bothered to refute these frivolous remarks.\nRight at that moment, Isla finished picking out her jewelry. She wanted to put on her heels but found it difficult to bend over due to the tight-fitting dress.\nIsla gave Keira a slight smile.\nImmediately, Poppy pushed Keira. \"Useless girl, always so oblivious! Your sister is having trouble. Now go on and help her put on her shoes!\"\nKeira was speechless.\nIt was always like this.\nDid Poppy still think she was that naive, ignorant little girl who wouldn't know how to fight back even when bullied?\nHer eyes were cold, and her voice hinted with impatience. \"You can help her yourself.\"\n\"Keira Olsen, what's this attitude? Do you think you've grown wings just because you're married now? Your husband is nothing more than a freeloader! In the end, you'll still need to rely on the Olsen family!\"\nPoppy raised her voice. \"If you don't make peace with your sister now, there will come a day when you and your husband will come begging her for help! Besides, the Olsen family raised you, so you should be serving the family like a servant!\"\nAt that moment, a tall figure appeared at the door. It was their father, Taylor Olsen.\nThe man frowned. \"A distinguished guest is about to arrive, and you're arguing here?\"\nIsla remained silent, playing innocent.\nPoppy, however, played the victim. \"It's all because of this cursed girl. She's looking down on her mother just because she got married today... \"\nTaylor fixed his gaze on Keira, \"You got married? Why didn't you let us help introduce someone decent to you? Where's the marriage certificate, let me see‚Ä¶ \"\nFaced with this estranged father's so-called concern, Keira hesitated for a moment before fishing out the printout from her bag.\nHowever, the very next second, it was snatched away by Poppy. \"Let me see what kind of loser you married!\"\nIsla asked curiously, \"Dad, who's coming that's got you so nervous?\"\nUpon thinking of the guest, Taylor instantly brightened up. He excitedly announced, \"It's Lewis Horton.\"\nKeira was immediately taken aback.\nWho?\nChapter 2: Husband!\nIsla looked confused, \"Who's Lewis Horton? Is he really important?\"\nKeira was also curious and listened.\nShe had some connections in Oceanion, but she had never heard that name.\nTaylor said, \"It's normal for you not to know him because he's a mystery. Even I have never met him. He is Jake Horton's young uncle. He's only 28 years old and is now the real power holder in the Horton family!\"\nPoppy gasped, \"Doesn't that make him a better match for Isla than Jake?\"\nThe one in power is much better than any legitimate grandson of the first branch!\nTaylor snapped, \"Nonsense, Mr. Horton is married!\"\nKeira narrowed her eyes.\nMarried...\nIf he really was the man in the marriage certificate, then it would seem that Lewis should know what's going on.\nPoppy seemed disappointed, \"Who's his wife? She's even luckier than Isla.\"\nKeira quickly looked at Taylor and heard him say, \"I don't know. It's said that he and his wife aren't fond of social engagements.\"\nTaylor frowned in deep thought. \"I'm not sure why he suddenly decided to come here today...\"\nThe Horton family is the top family in Oceanion, and the one in control has a very prestigious status.\nThe Olsen family is just slightly above average in terms of wealth. This marriage was viewed as Isla marrying up. It was impressive enough if the one in power could attend the wedding. Why would he personally show up for the betrothal?\nPoppy interrupted. \"Isla must be so outstanding that she has caught the Horton family's attention! Isla, this diamond necklace isn't grand enough for such important guests. Let's find something more extravagant!\"\nShe stuffed the printout back into Keira's hand and anxiously led Isla away to pick out new jewelry.\nShe seemed to care more about Isla than Mrs. Olsen, Isla's own mother.\nKeira gave a mocking smile.\n\"Sir, the Horton family is almost here.\"\nThe butler reminded Taylor. As he passed by Keira to go downstairs, he casually said, \"You haven't been home in a long time. Have a celebratory drink and then go.\"\nKeira nodded.\nShe wanted to stay and see who Lewis Horton really was!\nInside, Poppy helped Isla pick out her jewelry and put it on for her.\nLooking at the bright girl in front of her, Poppy couldn't hide her joy and satisfaction.\nOver twenty years ago, if it hadn't been for Jodie South, aka Mrs. Olsen, she would have married Taylor Olsen!\nShe despised Jodie, so purposely made a scene and gave birth on the same day before switching their children in the hospital.\nNow, her daughter was getting married in a grand way, and Jodie was even going to prepare an extravagant dowry for her!\nAs for Keira, who had been turned into an illegitimate daughter, she was penniless and had to marry a little punk!!\nHow the tables have turned. Poppy believed that Mrs. Olsen deserved it!\nDownstairs.\nKeira lazily stood in the shadow of the staircase, staring at the entrance and waiting quietly for the Horton family to arrive.\nAfter some time, Mrs. Olsen slowly walked downstairs with help from a servant. She wore a purple dress, looking slightly emaciated. She was full of scholarly spirit and seemed unapproachable.\nThe servant said softly, \"Ma'am, you're not well. It's better if you don't come down.\"\nMrs. Olsen shook her head and spoke while coughing, \"No... I can't... miss Isla's... important day...\"\nThey didn't notice Keira and headed toward the entrance.\nKeira watched Mrs. Olsen from behind, her eyes filled with admiration.\nIt was funny. Mrs. Olsen, who should have the right to hate Keira the most, was the only kind person she met in the Olsen family.\nPoppy didn't act like a mother at all and often forgot to feed Keira when she was young.\nAs a child, Keira was so skinny and malnourished that she dug around in trash cans for food as soon as she learned to walk.\nOne day Mrs. Olsen found her doing that, and started leaving food for her in the garden every day.\nShe kept up this routine for twelve years.\nIf it weren't for Mrs. Olsen's kindness, Keira probably would have died of hunger a long time ago.\nWatching Mrs. Olsen getting farther away and hearing the sound of her coughing from time to time, Keira frowned with worry.\nAt that moment, there was a commotion at the entrance. The Horton family had arrived!\nTaylor and Mrs. Olsen greeted them at the entrance. They exchanged a few words before stepping aside to let a group of people stream in.\nKeira caught sight of Lewis Horton at once.\nHe was wearing a well-tailored bespoke black suit and walking at the front like a moon surrounded by stars. His features were more distinct than in the photos, with a firm profile and strong jawline.\nHis deep-set eyes were brooding, his thin lips were stern-looking, and his every move exuded an air of sophistication.\nPerhaps sensing her gaze, the man suddenly looked back at her.\nFor a moment, their eyes met.\nHis sharp gaze made Keira's heart flutter. Just as she was trying to observe the emotions in his eyes, he shifted his gaze elsewhere.\nThis left Keira somewhat confused.\nFrom his attitude, she couldn't tell if he recognized her.\nTaylor asked with a smile, \"Mr. Horton, where's your wife? Didn't she come with you?\"\nAt the question, Keira felt Lewis Horton glance at her again. He casually replied, \"She couldn't make it.\"\nThey chatted while walking to the living room.\nJake Horton, who had pursued Keira for four years, followed behind the elders. Dressed in a suit, he seemed more mature and stable than in college. He didn't notice Keira and was whispering to Isla absent-mindedly.\nEveryone seated Lewis at the main seat and began to discuss the marriage arrangements.\nOnly then did Keira step out of the shadows.\nShe stood quietly there, watching the lively scene in the living room.\nSuddenly, her arm was grabbed by Poppy, who hissed at her, \"Keira, what are you still doing here? Can't you give up on Jake? Let me tell you. He's your brother-in-law now!\"\nKeira freed herself from her grip and smirked. \"Don't worry. I'm not interested in being a mistress. It was Mr. Olsen who asked me to stay for a celebratory drink.\"\nSince she was old enough to understand the situation, she had always addressed Taylor Olsen as \"Mr. Olsen\".\nPoppy gritted her teeth. \"That's just his polite way of speaking. You actually take it seriously? Do you really not know your place? In a gathering like this, even I can't embarrass the Olsens, let alone you, an illegitimate daughter. Are you worthy of having a seat at the table? You better leave now.\"\nKeira thought, 'Does she ever stop? It's so annoying!'\nKeira frowned impatiently, about to reply, but out of the corner of her eye, she noticed Lewis Horton standing up. He pointed to his phone and then walked toward the balcony, probably to take a call.\nKeira's eyes lit up. \"Fine, I'll go.\"\nShe brushed off Poppy and walked out of the living room, but didn't leave. Instead, she turned toward the direction of the balcony.\nThe balcony on the first floor was connected to the small garden outside.\nAs Keira got closer, the man on the phone quickly hung up before fixing his ice-cold gaze on her.\nKeira paused.\nMeeting his dangerous gaze, she suddenly smiled and asked tentatively, \"Honey?\"\nChapter 3: I'm Married\nA glass door separated the lively sounds in the living room.\nKeira was staring intently at Lewis Horton, observing his reactions.\nUpon hearing the way she addressed him, he became even more unapproachable. His dark eyes harbored a frosty gaze, devoid of any emotional fluctuation, and he turned to head back to the living room.\nKeira quickly stepped forward, blocking his way.\nLewis frowned a little. \"Out of my way.\"\nHis voice was deep and pleasant, and his tone carried a touch of elegance, which made people want to hear him speak even more.\nKeira suspected something. \"You... don't recognize me?\"\nLewis looked down at her. \"Should I?\"\nUpon entering the Olsen family home, he felt that an odd pair of eyes were closely following him.\nThat gaze was open and transparent, a far cry from the obsequious and nauseating glances of others.\nThat was why Lewis gave her a few more glances.\nThe girl was very beautiful. Her skin was fair. Her amorous eyes and the mole at the corner of her eye were attractive but not flirtatious. Although she stood in the corner obediently, she exuded a vague rebellious aura.\nAnd when she noticed him looking at her, she didn't evade. Instead, she looked right back at him.\nHe had initially thought she was different from the women who threw themselves at him but didn't expect her to be even bolder than them. She addressed him as \"honey\".\nLewis was a little impatient as he emphasized, \"Miss, I'm married. Please behave.\"\nKeira was a bit stunned.\nThis man clearly didn't recognize her, yet he said he was married. Was there a mistake in the Civil Affairs Bureau's registration?\nShe asked, \"May I ask who your wife is?\"\n\"It has nothing to do with you.\"\nHis answer was short and cold.\nKeira took out the photocopy of the marriage certificate and placed it in front of him, \"Mr. Horton, this man is you, right?\"\nLewis looked at the photocopy and noticed the name of the woman on it was Keira Olsen.\nLooking up again, he mocked her. \"Miss Olsen, an original isn't expensive, right? You should be more professional if you're forging this!\"\nWith that, Lewis didn't return to the living room. Instead, he strode off to the parking lot through the small garden.\nKeira ran after him, trying to talk it through, but she was blocked by two black-suited bodyguards.\nKeira stood her ground, calling out to him as he walked away. \"Mr. Horton, this document is genuine. If you don't believe it, you can check it with the Civil Affairs Bureau...\"\nLewis didn't stop. He got in the car and left straight away.\nHis personal assistant remained behind and returned to the living room, where he was met by Isla.\nIsla had just witnessed Keira clinging to Lewis Horton but didn't catch what exactly they were saying. Seeing Lewis leave and Keira riding out on her electric scooter to follow him, she immediately asked, \"Why did Mr. Horton leave? Did someone offend him?\"\nThe personal assistant smiled lightly. \"Mr. Horton has some matters to attend to and had to leave early. Could you please inform the elders of the household, Miss Olsen?\"\nThe boss didn't reprimand the girl, which meant he didn't hold it against her.\nIsla immediately nodded, courteously seeing the assistant out.\nAfter setting the wedding date and finishing lunch, the rest of the Horton family took their leave.\nAfter seeing off the guests, Taylor was worried. \"Why did Mr. Horton leave? Did we do anything to upset him?\"\nThinking back to how Jake seemed distracted all day as if he was looking for someone, and then to Keira's trouble-causing face, Isla clenched her fists.\nHer eyes flickered. \"Dad, I saw Keira pestering Mr. Horton. Mr. Horton seemed really angry when he left, and he left a message...\"\n\"What message?\"\n\"Mr. Horton said, he wants you to teach your daughter well.\" Isla bit her lip. \"With Keira behaving like this, will the Horton family think we're not disciplining her properly?\"\nTaylor's face turned ashen.\n-\nKeira was riding her electric scooter, and just as she left the villa area, she lost sight of Lewis.\nAs she was regretting her actions, her phone rang.\nUpon answering, she heard her subordinate, Samuel's voice over the line. \"Boss, a lot of people have been looking into who Dr. South is lately.\"\nKeira raised an eyebrow. \"They haven't uncovered anything, have they?\"\n\"Of course not. After all, no one would ever guess that Dr. South, who conquered the issue of hydrogen fuel, is actually a harmless-looking young woman who just graduated from college...\"\n\"Anything else?\" Keira cut off his rambling.\n\"Oh yes, I've found the information on Lewis Horton!\"\n\"Tell me.\"\n\"Lewis Horton is the second son of the Horton Family's old master. Rumor has it that he has a violent and ruthless personality, hence he was sent overseas when he was little. Everyone thought that the family property would be handed over to his elder brother, that is, Jake Horton's father. However, Lewis Horton returned to the country unexpectedly last week, using some ruthless method to force his old man to retire and take control of the Horton Group.\"\nSamuel curiously asked, \"Didn't you find a convenient person for a fake marriage today? How did the groom suddenly turn out to be such a cold-blooded fiend? Boss, if your marital status isn't stable, it'll affect the company's IPO...\"\nKeira frowned. \"Look up his contact information and schedule. I'll go talk to him again.\"\nThe reason she agreed to Poppy's absurd demand for an immediate marriage was that being married as the legal representative of the company would be more favorable for the IPO.\nBut she was married to a stranger and didn't know what plot she might be involved in.\nLewis Horton wasn't an ordinary person, so the best solution would be to get a divorce as soon as possible to avoid unnecessary disputes.\nAfter hanging up, Keira rubbed her temples.\nThings were a bit troublesome. Given Lewis Horton's status, he was escorted by bodyguards when he traveled, and it wouldn't be easy to meet him.\nShe shouldn't have impulsively called him \"honey\" earlier, which had upset him...\nShe sighed, started her little scooter, and slowly headed home.\nLeaving the bustling city center, she arrived at a city village on the outskirts.\nWhen she moved out of the Olsen family home in junior high school, she didn't have much money and could only afford to rent an old house here. She had since grown accustomed to it and never moved.\nAs she was about to reach her home after turning a corner, an old lady in her 80s or 90s suddenly sprang out from the side of the road!\nKeira slammed on the brakes, narrowly avoiding a collision.\nWhen she looked at the old woman, she initially thought the woman was trying to deliberately provoke an accident, but quickly realized something was wrong.\nAlthough the old woman was thin and short, she was well-dressed and didn't appear to be from an ordinary family. She had a tag around her neck, which had a contact number with a note that said, \"If you find this lady, please dial this number. A reward will be given.\"\nIt had to be Alzheimer's disease.\nSomeone was missing a family member.\nKeira immediately took out her phone and began to dial the number on the tag.\nThe old woman was staring blankly before, but she suddenly became active. She grabbed Keira's wrist, her cloudy eyes shining brightly. \"Granddaughter-in-law! You are my granddaughter-in-law!\"\nThe corner of Keira's mouth twitched.\nShe had been single for 22 years, but suddenly she had another husband.\nWas the Civil Affairs Bureau doing husband wholesale these days?\nShe found it amusing and casually asked, \"Granny, who is your grandson?\"\nThe old lady racked her brains.\nWhat was her grandson's name again... Oh right, Lewis Horton!!\n------------------------------------------------------\nInstall our App and search üî•<My Accidental Husband is a Billionaire!>üî• to read more exciting chapters"

        "\"You're already married! Why are you here to register again?!\n\"Don't you realize it's a crime to be a bigamist?\"\n‚Ä¶\nKeira Olsen, startled, stepped out of the Civil Affairs Bureau, holding a just-printed marriage certificate.\nThe man who had accompanied her here to register looked at the stunning woman and lamented, \"Miss Olsen, you're already married. Why did you hire me for a sham wedding?\"\nAfter saying that the deposit was non-refundable, he left in a hurry.\nKeira bit her lip, still reeling from the shock.\nShe'd never even had a boyfriend. How could she possibly be married?!\nShe lowered her head to look at the printout in her hands.\nIn the certificate photo, the girl appeared a bit constrained with a forced smile. The mole on the corner of her eye proved that it was indeed her. As for the man...\nHe had heavy features and a prominent nose. His thin lips curved into a faint smile as he stared into the camera lens intently as if they were piercing through the paper.\nHis mystery and commanding presence couldn't be concealed, even in a black-and-white photo.\nShe then looked at his name: Lewis Horton.\nShe was certain she never met this man!\nWhat on earth was going on?!\nKeira took out her phone, snapped a picture of the certificate, opened WhatsApp, and sent it to a contact with a black avatar. \"Help me figure out who this is.\"\nShe got an instant reply. \"Got it.\"\nOnly then did Keira momentarily set aside her confusion. She climbed onto her old electric scooter and slowly rode into an upscale villa area, returning to the Olsen family.\nToday was her older sister, Isla Olsen's, big day. Her future husband was coming over for the betrothal.\nThe house was brilliantly decorated with servants busying about in an orderly fashion. A few temp workers had also been hired for the occasion.\nKeira parked her scooter in a corner and heard the chatter of the temp workers and servants she passed by.\n\"Who is she? She's so pretty!\"\n\"Shush, she's the illegitimate daughter that the Boss doesn't acknowledge.\"\n\"Her mom was the mistress. When Mrs. Olsen was about to give birth, she showed up heavily pregnant, demanding rights, and they both delivered on the same day. That old woman has got balls. She has made up all sorts of excuses and not left the house.\"\n\"At least Miss Keira knows her place. She moved out in junior high and hasn't been back for many years. I wonder what brings her here today...\"\nKeira kept her gaze lowered, pretending not to hear their talk, and walked into the living room.\nHer mother, Poppy Hill, was waiting at the door. The woman, still elegant at such an age, anxiously pulled her upstairs as soon as she entered the house. \"Come with me to see your sister. By the way, did you get the marriage certificate?\"\nThere was no emotion in Keira's voice. \"Yes.\"\nIt was technically true, even though the groom was someone else.\n\"That's good. You have to remember your place. Jake Horton is your sister's fianc√©. He's from a high-ranking noble family, something an illegitimate child like you could never hope for! Only your sister is worthy of him!\"\nHearing these words, a touch of mockery flashed in Keira's eyes.\nJake Horton, the legitimate grandson of the first branch of Oceanion's preeminent Horton family, pursued her for four years in college, only to propose to Isla on graduation day...\nUpon learning about the proposal, Poppy demanded Keira to immediately find someone else to marry, extinguishing any potential between her and Jake.\nThat's how it had always been...\nWhenever there was even the slightest chance of a conflict of interest between her and Isla, Poppy would demand her to unconditionally give way.\nBecause she was the illegitimate daughter, her mere existence was a sin.\nAs a child, she was brainwashed into believing that undergoing all those hardships was a natural thing.\nBut now she was no longer oblivious.\nKeira's expression was solemn as she stressed each word, \"We agreed. This is the last time.\"\nPoppy was the culprit. She was the one who clung to the Olsen family day after day just to see her man, and she was the one who wanted to appease Isla. Keira wouldn't ruin her own life for Poppy's sake.\nToday's event was to repay Poppy for giving birth to her. After that, they were even.\nPoppy sounded annoyed. \"I heard you.\"\nIn the middle of their conversation, they arrived at Isla's room.\nThe pretty girl was like a princess in her stunning dress. She was sitting on the sofa selecting her jewelry, and the room was filled with the glamorous sparkle of gemstones.\nKeira, dressed simply, maintained her straight posture despite the contrast.\nIsla greeted her upon seeing her. \"Keira, what brings you here?\"\nBefore Keira could answer, Poppy interjected, \"Isla, Keira got married today.\"\nIsla was surprised. \"So soon? Who's the guy? Is he better than Jake?\"\nPoppy said in a mocking tone, \"Of course not! There isn't a single person in all of Oceanion of higher standing than young Mr. Horton! Isla, do you really think she could find a decent suitor? The loser she married didn't even dare to come here with her. He's afraid that his poverty-stricken appearance will offend your sight!\"\nIsla asked with a hint of jealousy, \"How can that be? Keira's so pretty; otherwise Jake wouldn't have pursued her for four years.\"\n\"What's the use of being pretty? A shabby shoe will only match a ragged sock. Given her status, only the scum of society would marry her. Young Mr. Horton merely saw her as a toy and a passing amusement. Only you, Isla, with your status, are a match for young Mr. Horton‚Ä¶\"\nKeira frowned.\nThe man in the photo, with his looks and presence, didn't seem to correspond with Poppy's description of a ghetto husband and scum at all.\nBut she couldn't be bothered to refute these frivolous remarks.\nRight at that moment, Isla finished picking out her jewelry. She wanted to put on her heels but found it difficult to bend over due to the tight-fitting dress.\nIsla gave Keira a slight smile.\nImmediately, Poppy pushed Keira. \"Useless girl, always so oblivious! Your sister is having trouble. Now go on and help her put on her shoes!\"\nKeira was speechless.\nIt was always like this.\nDid Poppy still think she was that naive, ignorant little girl who wouldn't know how to fight back even when bullied?\nHer eyes were cold, and her voice hinted with impatience. \"You can help her yourself.\"\n\"Keira Olsen, what's this attitude? Do you think you've grown wings just because you're married now? Your husband is nothing more than a freeloader! In the end, you'll still need to rely on the Olsen family!\"\nPoppy raised her voice. \"If you don't make peace with your sister now, there will come a day when you and your husband will come begging her for help! Besides, the Olsen family raised you, so you should be serving the family like a servant!\"\nAt that moment, a tall figure appeared at the door. It was their father, Taylor Olsen.\nThe man frowned. \"A distinguished guest is about to arrive, and you're arguing here?\"\nIsla remained silent, playing innocent.\nPoppy, however, played the victim. \"It's all because of this cursed girl. She's looking down on her mother just because she got married today... \"\nTaylor fixed his gaze on Keira, \"You got married? Why didn't you let us help introduce someone decent to you? Where's the marriage certificate, let me see‚Ä¶ \"\nFaced with this estranged father's so-called concern, Keira hesitated for a moment before fishing out the printout from her bag.\nHowever, the very next second, it was snatched away by Poppy. \"Let me see what kind of loser you married!\"\nIsla asked curiously, \"Dad, who's coming that's got you so nervous?\"\nUpon thinking of the guest, Taylor instantly brightened up. He excitedly announced, \"It's Lewis Horton.\"\nKeira was immediately taken aback.\nWho?\nChapter 2: Husband!\nIsla looked confused, \"Who's Lewis Horton? Is he really important?\"\nKeira was also curious and listened.\nShe had some connections in Oceanion, but she had never heard that name.\nTaylor said, \"It's normal for you not to know him because he's a mystery. Even I have never met him. He is Jake Horton's young uncle. He's only 28 years old and is now the real power holder in the Horton family!\"\nPoppy gasped, \"Doesn't that make him a better match for Isla than Jake?\"\nThe one in power is much better than any legitimate grandson of the first branch!\nTaylor snapped, \"Nonsense, Mr. Horton is married!\"\nKeira narrowed her eyes.\nMarried...\nIf he really was the man in the marriage certificate, then it would seem that Lewis should know what's going on.\nPoppy seemed disappointed, \"Who's his wife? She's even luckier than Isla.\"\nKeira quickly looked at Taylor and heard him say, \"I don't know. It's said that he and his wife aren't fond of social engagements.\"\nTaylor frowned in deep thought. \"I'm not sure why he suddenly decided to come here today...\"\nThe Horton family is the top family in Oceanion, and the one in control has a very prestigious status.\nThe Olsen family is just slightly above average in terms of wealth. This marriage was viewed as Isla marrying up. It was impressive enough if the one in power could attend the wedding. Why would he personally show up for the betrothal?\nPoppy interrupted. \"Isla must be so outstanding that she has caught the Horton family's attention! Isla, this diamond necklace isn't grand enough for such important guests. Let's find something more extravagant!\"\nShe stuffed the printout back into Keira's hand and anxiously led Isla away to pick out new jewelry.\nShe seemed to care more about Isla than Mrs. Olsen, Isla's own mother.\nKeira gave a mocking smile.\n\"Sir, the Horton family is almost here.\"\nThe butler reminded Taylor. As he passed by Keira to go downstairs, he casually said, \"You haven't been home in a long time. Have a celebratory drink and then go.\"\nKeira nodded.\nShe wanted to stay and see who Lewis Horton really was!\nInside, Poppy helped Isla pick out her jewelry and put it on for her.\nLooking at the bright girl in front of her, Poppy couldn't hide her joy and satisfaction.\nOver twenty years ago, if it hadn't been for Jodie South, aka Mrs. Olsen, she would have married Taylor Olsen!\nShe despised Jodie, so purposely made a scene and gave birth on the same day before switching their children in the hospital.\nNow, her daughter was getting married in a grand way, and Jodie was even going to prepare an extravagant dowry for her!\nAs for Keira, who had been turned into an illegitimate daughter, she was penniless and had to marry a little punk!!\nHow the tables have turned. Poppy believed that Mrs. Olsen deserved it!\nDownstairs.\nKeira lazily stood in the shadow of the staircase, staring at the entrance and waiting quietly for the Horton family to arrive.\nAfter some time, Mrs. Olsen slowly walked downstairs with help from a servant. She wore a purple dress, looking slightly emaciated. She was full of scholarly spirit and seemed unapproachable.\nThe servant said softly, \"Ma'am, you're not well. It's better if you don't come down.\"\nMrs. Olsen shook her head and spoke while coughing, \"No... I can't... miss Isla's... important day...\"\nThey didn't notice Keira and headed toward the entrance.\nKeira watched Mrs. Olsen from behind, her eyes filled with admiration.\nIt was funny. Mrs. Olsen, who should have the right to hate Keira the most, was the only kind person she met in the Olsen family.\nPoppy didn't act like a mother at all and often forgot to feed Keira when she was young.\nAs a child, Keira was so skinny and malnourished that she dug around in trash cans for food as soon as she learned to walk.\nOne day Mrs. Olsen found her doing that, and started leaving food for her in the garden every day.\nShe kept up this routine for twelve years.\nIf it weren't for Mrs. Olsen's kindness, Keira probably would have died of hunger a long time ago.\nWatching Mrs. Olsen getting farther away and hearing the sound of her coughing from time to time, Keira frowned with worry.\nAt that moment, there was a commotion at the entrance. The Horton family had arrived!\nTaylor and Mrs. Olsen greeted them at the entrance. They exchanged a few words before stepping aside to let a group of people stream in.\nKeira caught sight of Lewis Horton at once.\nHe was wearing a well-tailored bespoke black suit and walking at the front like a moon surrounded by stars. His features were more distinct than in the photos, with a firm profile and strong jawline.\nHis deep-set eyes were brooding, his thin lips were stern-looking, and his every move exuded an air of sophistication.\nPerhaps sensing her gaze, the man suddenly looked back at her.\nFor a moment, their eyes met.\nHis sharp gaze made Keira's heart flutter. Just as she was trying to observe the emotions in his eyes, he shifted his gaze elsewhere.\nThis left Keira somewhat confused.\nFrom his attitude, she couldn't tell if he recognized her.\nTaylor asked with a smile, \"Mr. Horton, where's your wife? Didn't she come with you?\"\nAt the question, Keira felt Lewis Horton glance at her again. He casually replied, \"She couldn't make it.\"\nThey chatted while walking to the living room.\nJake Horton, who had pursued Keira for four years, followed behind the elders. Dressed in a suit, he seemed more mature and stable than in college. He didn't notice Keira and was whispering to Isla absent-mindedly.\nEveryone seated Lewis at the main seat and began to discuss the marriage arrangements.\nOnly then did Keira step out of the shadows.\nShe stood quietly there, watching the lively scene in the living room.\nSuddenly, her arm was grabbed by Poppy, who hissed at her, \"Keira, what are you still doing here? Can't you give up on Jake? Let me tell you. He's your brother-in-law now!\"\nKeira freed herself from her grip and smirked. \"Don't worry. I'm not interested in being a mistress. It was Mr. Olsen who asked me to stay for a celebratory drink.\"\nSince she was old enough to understand the situation, she had always addressed Taylor Olsen as \"Mr. Olsen\".\nPoppy gritted her teeth. \"That's just his polite way of speaking. You actually take it seriously? Do you really not know your place? In a gathering like this, even I can't embarrass the Olsens, let alone you, an illegitimate daughter. Are you worthy of having a seat at the table? You better leave now.\"\nKeira thought, 'Does she ever stop? It's so annoying!'\nKeira frowned impatiently, about to reply, but out of the corner of her eye, she noticed Lewis Horton standing up. He pointed to his phone and then walked toward the balcony, probably to take a call.\nKeira's eyes lit up. \"Fine, I'll go.\"\nShe brushed off Poppy and walked out of the living room, but didn't leave. Instead, she turned toward the direction of the balcony.\nThe balcony on the first floor was connected to the small garden outside.\nAs Keira got closer, the man on the phone quickly hung up before fixing his ice-cold gaze on her.\nKeira paused.\nMeeting his dangerous gaze, she suddenly smiled and asked tentatively, \"Honey?\"\nChapter 3: I'm Married\nA glass door separated the lively sounds in the living room.\nKeira was staring intently at Lewis Horton, observing his reactions.\nUpon hearing the way she addressed him, he became even more unapproachable. His dark eyes harbored a frosty gaze, devoid of any emotional fluctuation, and he turned to head back to the living room.\nKeira quickly stepped forward, blocking his way.\nLewis frowned a little. \"Out of my way.\"\nHis voice was deep and pleasant, and his tone carried a touch of elegance, which made people want to hear him speak even more.\nKeira suspected something. \"You... don't recognize me?\"\nLewis looked down at her. \"Should I?\"\nUpon entering the Olsen family home, he felt that an odd pair of eyes were closely following him.\nThat gaze was open and transparent, a far cry from the obsequious and nauseating glances of others.\nThat was why Lewis gave her a few more glances.\nThe girl was very beautiful. Her skin was fair. Her amorous eyes and the mole at the corner of her eye were attractive but not flirtatious. Although she stood in the corner obediently, she exuded a vague rebellious aura.\nAnd when she noticed him looking at her, she didn't evade. Instead, she looked right back at him.\nHe had initially thought she was different from the women who threw themselves at him but didn't expect her to be even bolder than them. She addressed him as \"honey\".\nLewis was a little impatient as he emphasized, \"Miss, I'm married. Please behave.\"\nKeira was a bit stunned.\nThis man clearly didn't recognize her, yet he said he was married. Was there a mistake in the Civil Affairs Bureau's registration?\nShe asked, \"May I ask who your wife is?\"\n\"It has nothing to do with you.\"\nHis answer was short and cold.\nKeira took out the photocopy of the marriage certificate and placed it in front of him, \"Mr. Horton, this man is you, right?\"\nLewis looked at the photocopy and noticed the name of the woman on it was Keira Olsen.\nLooking up again, he mocked her. \"Miss Olsen, an original isn't expensive, right? You should be more professional if you're forging this!\"\nWith that, Lewis didn't return to the living room. Instead, he strode off to the parking lot through the small garden.\nKeira ran after him, trying to talk it through, but she was blocked by two black-suited bodyguards.\nKeira stood her ground, calling out to him as he walked away. \"Mr. Horton, this document is genuine. If you don't believe it, you can check it with the Civil Affairs Bureau...\"\nLewis didn't stop. He got in the car and left straight away.\nHis personal assistant remained behind and returned to the living room, where he was met by Isla.\nIsla had just witnessed Keira clinging to Lewis Horton but didn't catch what exactly they were saying. Seeing Lewis leave and Keira riding out on her electric scooter to follow him, she immediately asked, \"Why did Mr. Horton leave? Did someone offend him?\"\nThe personal assistant smiled lightly. \"Mr. Horton has some matters to attend to and had to leave early. Could you please inform the elders of the household, Miss Olsen?\"\nThe boss didn't reprimand the girl, which meant he didn't hold it against her.\nIsla immediately nodded, courteously seeing the assistant out.\nAfter setting the wedding date and finishing lunch, the rest of the Horton family took their leave.\nAfter seeing off the guests, Taylor was worried. \"Why did Mr. Horton leave? Did we do anything to upset him?\"\nThinking back to how Jake seemed distracted all day as if he was looking for someone, and then to Keira's trouble-causing face, Isla clenched her fists.\nHer eyes flickered. \"Dad, I saw Keira pestering Mr. Horton. Mr. Horton seemed really angry when he left, and he left a message...\"\n\"What message?\"\n\"Mr. Horton said, he wants you to teach your daughter well.\" Isla bit her lip. \"With Keira behaving like this, will the Horton family think we're not disciplining her properly?\"\nTaylor's face turned ashen.\n-\nKeira was riding her electric scooter, and just as she left the villa area, she lost sight of Lewis.\nAs she was regretting her actions, her phone rang.\nUpon answering, she heard her subordinate, Samuel's voice over the line. \"Boss, a lot of people have been looking into who Dr. South is lately.\"\nKeira raised an eyebrow. \"They haven't uncovered anything, have they?\"\n\"Of course not. After all, no one would ever guess that Dr. South, who conquered the issue of hydrogen fuel, is actually a harmless-looking young woman who just graduated from college...\"\n\"Anything else?\" Keira cut off his rambling.\n\"Oh yes, I've found the information on Lewis Horton!\"\n\"Tell me.\"\n\"Lewis Horton is the second son of the Horton Family's old master. Rumor has it that he has a violent and ruthless personality, hence he was sent overseas when he was little. Everyone thought that the family property would be handed over to his elder brother, that is, Jake Horton's father. However, Lewis Horton returned to the country unexpectedly last week, using some ruthless method to force his old man to retire and take control of the Horton Group.\"\nSamuel curiously asked, \"Didn't you find a convenient person for a fake marriage today? How did the groom suddenly turn out to be such a cold-blooded fiend? Boss, if your marital status isn't stable, it'll affect the company's IPO...\"\nKeira frowned. \"Look up his contact information and schedule. I'll go talk to him again.\"\nThe reason she agreed to Poppy's absurd demand for an immediate marriage was that being married as the legal representative of the company would be more favorable for the IPO.\nBut she was married to a stranger and didn't know what plot she might be involved in.\nLewis Horton wasn't an ordinary person, so the best solution would be to get a divorce as soon as possible to avoid unnecessary disputes.\nAfter hanging up, Keira rubbed her temples.\nThings were a bit troublesome. Given Lewis Horton's status, he was escorted by bodyguards when he traveled, and it wouldn't be easy to meet him.\nShe shouldn't have impulsively called him \"honey\" earlier, which had upset him...\nShe sighed, started her little scooter, and slowly headed home.\nLeaving the bustling city center, she arrived at a city village on the outskirts.\nWhen she moved out of the Olsen family home in junior high school, she didn't have much money and could only afford to rent an old house here. She had since grown accustomed to it and never moved.\nAs she was about to reach her home after turning a corner, an old lady in her 80s or 90s suddenly sprang out from the side of the road!\nKeira slammed on the brakes, narrowly avoiding a collision.\nWhen she looked at the old woman, she initially thought the woman was trying to deliberately provoke an accident, but quickly realized something was wrong.\nAlthough the old woman was thin and short, she was well-dressed and didn't appear to be from an ordinary family. She had a tag around her neck, which had a contact number with a note that said, \"If you find this lady, please dial this number. A reward will be given.\"\nIt had to be Alzheimer's disease.\nSomeone was missing a family member.\nKeira immediately took out her phone and began to dial the number on the tag.\nThe old woman was staring blankly before, but she suddenly became active. She grabbed Keira's wrist, her cloudy eyes shining brightly. \"Granddaughter-in-law! You are my granddaughter-in-law!\"\nThe corner of Keira's mouth twitched.\nShe had been single for 22 years, but suddenly she had another husband.\nWas the Civil Affairs Bureau doing husband wholesale these days?\nShe found it amusing and casually asked, \"Granny, who is your grandson?\"\nThe old lady racked her brains.\nWhat was her grandson's name again... Oh right, Lewis Horton!!\n------------------------------------------------------\nInstall our App and search üî•<My Accidental Husband is a Billionaire!>üî• to read more exciting chapters"
